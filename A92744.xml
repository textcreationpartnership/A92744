         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Words thus explained, I ≈øhall re≈øolve the ≈øen≈øe of them into the≈øe five Propo≈øitions.</p>
               <p n="1">I. That a Man; or the Soul of a Man is a Thing of <hi>ine≈øtimable</hi> Price and Value; for our <hi>Saviour</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:154348:8"/>here weighs it again≈øt the whole World, that is, again≈øt all the <hi>Plea≈øures, Profits,</hi> and <hi>Honours</hi> that this <hi>inferiour</hi> World can afford; and declares that in the <hi>ju≈øt</hi> Ballance of his E≈øteem it out-weighs them all. And certainly that mu≈øt needs be <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding precious,</hi> who≈øe Worth the whole World cannot <hi>counter-poi≈øe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. That this <hi>precious</hi> Soul may be lo≈øt. This our <hi>Saviour</hi> plainly ≈øuppo≈øes in the≈øe Words, <hi>if he lo≈øe his own Soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. That our <hi>renouncing</hi> of <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> and his <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> will mo≈øt certainly infer this Lo≈øs. For the≈øe Words, as I have ≈øhewed you, our <hi>Saviour</hi> urges as an Argument to di≈ø≈øuade Men from <hi>Apo≈øtacy;</hi> but if without <hi>lo≈øing</hi> our Souls, we might <hi>renounce</hi> him and <hi>apo≈øtatize</hi> from him, there would be no <hi>Force</hi> in all this Argument to di≈ø≈øuade us from it.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. That when this Soul is <hi>lo≈øt,</hi> 'tis <hi>lo≈øt</hi> irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verably. <hi>What ≈øhall a Man give in exchange for his Soul?</hi> where the <hi>Greek</hi> Word <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="5">V.

               <p n="5">5. And <hi>La≈øtly,</hi> Let us con≈øider the va≈øt Price which the <hi>Devils</hi> them≈øelves do put upon Souls; for ever ≈øince tho≈øe <hi>malignant</hi> Spirits through their <hi>own</hi> Pride and Ambition revolted from <hi>God,</hi> and con≈øpired to make War with <hi>heaven,</hi> and revenge their Expul≈øion thence, the <hi>con≈øtant</hi> Drift of all their De≈øigns and Actions hath been to ≈øeduce and ruine them, being con≈øcious that of all the Beings that are within the reach of their Power, there are none ≈øo <hi>dear</hi> to <hi>God</hi> as the≈øe, and that by ≈øedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing from him the≈øe his mo≈øt <hi>precious</hi> Creatures, they ≈øhall do him the <hi>greatest</hi> ≈øpight and mo≈øt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually revenge upon him their <hi>own</hi> Damnation. For doubtle≈øs were there any Beings below the Moon more <hi>dear</hi> to <hi>God</hi> than the≈øe, they would bend their Force and Malice again≈øt them, and not make the≈øe as they do, the <hi>only</hi> Centers of their <hi>mi≈øchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous</hi> Activity.

And how <hi>ambitious</hi> they are of ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing our Souls, and training them on to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, is evident by the <hi>infinite</hi> Wiles, and Snares, and Stratagems they contrive again≈øt them; by their <hi>unwearied</hi> Diligence to watch all Opportunities a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt them; to ≈øurprize them where they are <hi>care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs,</hi> and a≈ø≈øault them where they are <hi>weake≈øt,</hi> and cheat them with <hi>di≈øgui≈øed</hi> Sugge≈øtions; to in≈øpect
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:154348:20"/>their Humours, and apply them≈øelves to their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øt, and nick their Tempers, with convenient <hi>Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</hi> And if after all their Labout, Craft, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance they can but ≈øei≈øe the Game they hunt for, the Blood of a Soul is ≈øo <hi>rich</hi> a Draught that they think it a <hi>≈øufficient</hi> Recompence for all their <hi>painful</hi> and <hi>mi≈øchievous</hi> Devices; for St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us that <hi>they go about like roaring Lions, ≈øeeking whom they may devour.</hi> And to be ≈øure tho≈øe <hi>malignant</hi> Spirits would never be ≈øo impertinently <hi>mi≈øchievous,</hi> as to ≈øpend their time in catching Flies; and did they not know our Souls to be <hi>noble</hi> Preys, they would never go ≈øo far about as they do, nor take ≈øo much Care and Pains to Catch and In≈ønare them. So that from their <hi>unwearied</hi> Diligence to ≈øeduce and ruin us, we may mo≈øt certainly conclude either that they are very <hi>fooli≈øh</hi> Devils, or that our Souls are very <hi>precious Beings;</hi> but how≈øoever, their Diligence to de≈øtroy them is a <hi>plain</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that they e≈øteem them <hi>precious,</hi> it being by no means to be ≈øuppo≈øed, that ≈øuch <hi>Wi≈øe</hi> and <hi>Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent</hi> Beings as they are would ≈øo much concern them≈øelves, as they do about things which they had <hi>little,</hi> or <hi>no</hi> E≈øteem for.</p>
               <p>And thus you ≈øee at what a <hi>vast</hi> Rate our Souls are valued by the whole World of Spirits, how from the <hi>highest</hi> to the <hi>lowest,</hi> tho≈øe <hi>best</hi> and <hi>wi≈øe≈øt</hi> Judges of the <hi>ju≈øt</hi> Worth of Souls do all unanimou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concur in a <hi>great</hi> and <hi>high</hi> E≈øtimation.

And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he is ≈øaid to <hi>put it into the heart of Judas to betray Chri≈øt,</hi> John 13.2.

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:154348:49"/>And as <hi>little</hi> Advantage it would be to a <hi>wicked</hi> Soul to be pardoned and ab≈øolved by <hi>God,</hi> while ≈øhe hath a Di≈øea≈øe within her that preys upon her Vitals, and ha≈øtens her to a <hi>certain</hi> Ruin.

Had the Condition of his Mercy been but one ≈øtep <hi>lower</hi> than Repentance, it had totally di≈ø≈øolved the Obligation of his Laws, and reduced the <hi>humane</hi> World into a <hi>perfect Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.</hi> For ≈øhould be have pro≈øtituted his Mercy to <hi>impenitent</hi> Sinners, he mu≈øt have made it a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge for <hi>ob≈øtinate</hi> Rebels to fly to, and ≈øhelter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves from the Reach of his Authority; and how <hi>incon≈øi≈øtent</hi> would this have been with the Wi≈ødom of his Government? This therefore being the <hi>lowe≈øt</hi> Condition upon which the <hi>wi≈øe</hi> and <hi>holy God</hi> can propo≈øe his Mercy to us, there is no Ground to hope that after we have rejected <hi>this,</hi> and are

So that when once we have finally rejected our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and ≈øhaken hands <hi>for ever</hi> with Faith and Obedience, and Repentance too, we are quite beyond the Reach of any <hi>wi≈øe</hi> Mercy; and then how <hi>deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> mu≈øt our Condition be, when Things are redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to this <hi>de≈øperate</hi> I≈ø≈øue, That God mu≈øt either con≈øent to be fooli≈øhly <hi>merciful</hi> to us, or to abandon our Souls to <hi>everla≈øting</hi> Perdition?</p>

For the <hi>la≈øt</hi> Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which <hi>God</hi> hath prepared for Mankind to heal the Malignity of their Natures, and recover them from <hi>eternal</hi> Mi≈øery, is the <hi>meritorious</hi> Death and Sacrifice of his <hi>Ble≈ø≈øed Son,</hi> who voluntarily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking to be the <hi>Attorney-General,</hi> and <hi>Common Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øentative</hi> of <hi>≈øinful</hi> Men, ≈øuffered Death in our ≈øtead as a <hi>vicarious</hi> Mulct and Puni≈øhment for our Sins; upon which the mo≈øt <hi>merciful</hi> Father hath granted to all <hi>believing</hi> and <hi>truly penitent</hi> Sinners, a <hi>general</hi> Indemnity from <hi>eternal</hi> Puni≈øhments, to which they were bound over by their Sins and Rebellions; by virtue of which Grant as ≈øoon as we believe in <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> and do thereupon ≈øincerely Repent of our Sins, we are totally ab≈øolved from tho≈øe <hi>everla≈øting</hi> Puni≈øhments whereunto they have
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:154348:51"/>expo≈øed and obliged us. And this Sacrifice of <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> being the la≈øt Remedy which <hi>God</hi> hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for our <hi>Guilt,</hi> and the Grant of Pardon <hi>God</hi> hath made in Con≈øideration of it, being confined to <hi>believing</hi> and <hi>penitent</hi> Sinners, it hence nece≈ø≈øarily follows, that they who finally per≈øi≈øt in <hi>

So that by renouncing <hi>Christ</hi> we do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his Sacrifice, which is the <hi>la≈øt</hi> and only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy we have to depend upon. Hence <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.26. we are told, that <hi>if we ≈øin wilfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no more ≈øacrifice for ≈øin;</hi> that is, after we have been Baptized, and Initiated into <hi>Chri≈øtianity,</hi> we relap≈øe into Infidelity or <hi>wilful</hi> Di≈øobedience, we do thereby forfeit our Intere≈øt in Chri≈øt's Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; and when we have once rejected our Intere≈øt in that, there remains no other Sacrifice for Sin, <hi>i.e.</hi> no other Sacrifice upon which <hi>God</hi> will Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Indemnify us. So that now all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to us, is that which follows in the next Ver≈øe, <hi>viz.

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:154348:51"/>Hopes of Recovery, into <hi>endle≈øs</hi> and <hi>irrever≈øible</hi> Damnation.

               <p>What then remains, that ≈øince our <hi>for≈øaking of Chri≈øt</hi> will ≈øo infallibly infer the Ruin of our Souls, we all return to, and cleave <hi>fa≈øt</hi> to our <hi>Saviour</hi> in our Belief and Obedience: That we, who are fallen <hi>off</hi> from him into a Cour≈øe of <hi>wilful</hi> Sin and Di≈øobedience, immediately return again by a <hi>deep</hi> and <hi>≈øerious</hi> Repentance.

               <p>Wherefore as we tender the ≈øafety of our <hi>preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> Souls, let us ≈øpeedily for≈øake this <hi>dangerous</hi> Road in which Perdition <hi>way-lays,</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> gapes to devour us every ≈øtep we go; and return unto our Lord in whom our ≈øafety lyes.

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:154348:58"/>warn and ≈øecure <hi>others</hi> from tho≈øe <hi>de≈øperate</hi> Cour≈øes that ruined us.

And when by being ob≈øtinately <hi>deaf</hi> to the Threat of <hi>eternal</hi> Perdition, which <hi>God</hi> denounced on purpo≈øe to oblige us to be <hi>happy,</hi> we have not only forfeited our ≈øelves to it, but have al≈øo <hi>≈øinned</hi> our ≈øelves into an Incapacity of having any <hi>good</hi> done upon us; the only U≈øe which the <hi>Divine goodne≈øs</hi> can make of us for the <hi>future,</hi> is to do <hi>good</hi> to others by us; which it can no otherwi≈øe do, but by making our <hi>everlasting</hi> Suffering an <hi>everla≈øting</hi> Example for them to take warning by. For though there is no doubt but every <hi>virtuous</hi> Soul ≈øhall be hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ≈øo confirmed in its ≈øtate of Beatitude, as that it ≈øhall never fall from it, yet ≈øhall it be confirmed no otherwi≈øe than by the force of tho≈øe Rea≈øons and <hi>invincible</hi> Motives which ≈øhall then continually urge, and immoveably determine it unto that which is good: One of which Rea≈øons, as we may rea≈øonably ≈øuppo≈øe, will be their pro≈øpect of the <hi>endle≈øs</hi> Mi≈øeries of the <hi>Damned,</hi> which will be an <hi>everla≈øting</hi> Monitor to them, and together with their <hi>own</hi> fen≈øe of the <hi>ravi≈øhing</hi> Plea≈øures of <hi>Goodne≈øs,</hi> will ≈øecure them <hi>for ever</hi> from falling.

               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> And la≈øtly, This al≈øo appears, becau≈øe if after he hath thus declared him≈øelf, there were any Rea≈øon to think that he is not determined to act accordingly, that Rea≈øon would warrant us to believe that this Declaration was only intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a <hi>Scare-crow,</hi> and con≈øequently to contemn and de≈øpi≈øe it. For again≈øt all that hath been ≈øaid, it may be (and is by ≈øome Men) objected, That <hi>God</hi> is not bound to do as he threatens; that when by our Di≈øobedience we have incurred the Penalty he threatens, he hath an <hi>undoubted</hi> Right indeed to inflict it upon us, and con≈øequently may, if he plea≈øe, inflict it without any Wrong or Inju≈øtice; but then, if he plea≈øe, he may di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen≈øe with it <hi>too,</hi> either in the <hi>whole,</hi> or in part, as he ≈øees convenient. For the Puni≈øhment being only a Debt which the Sinner owes to him, he is
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:154348:61"/>no more obliged than <hi>other</hi> Creditors are to exact the <hi>utmo≈øt</hi> farthing of it; but may exact or remit the <hi>whole,</hi> or abate what part ≈øoever he plea≈øes; and therefore it is to be hoped, that he being a <hi>merciful</hi> Creditor will not be ≈øo <hi>extreme</hi> and <hi>rigorous</hi> as to exact of us the <hi>utmo≈øt</hi> Puni≈øhment we owe him; but that when he hath made us <hi>≈ømart</hi> a while for our Folly, he will either relea≈øe us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a more <hi>happy</hi> Condition, or put an end to our Beings and Mi≈øeries together. To which I might an≈øwer, That when by our Sins we have forfeited our ≈øelves to the <hi>ju≈øt</hi> Vengeance of <hi>God,</hi> it is <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite</hi> Mercy and Goodne≈øs to others, to puni≈øh us according to his Threatning; and therefore when we by our sins have render'd our ≈øelves <hi>incapable</hi> of his Mercy, that Mercy which now inclines him to do <hi>good</hi> to <hi>us,</hi> will then equally incline him to <hi>good</hi> to <hi>other,</hi> by the <hi>dreadful</hi> Example of our Puni≈øhment; and ≈øo he may be a very <hi>merciful</hi> Creditor, and notwith≈øtanding exact of us the <hi>ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt</hi> Farthing. But this I have already largely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øted on, and therefore, <hi>2dly.</hi> I an≈øwer, That what God may do is not for us to determine when he may, or may not, and is obliged to neither; but when he hath expre≈øly denounced what he will do, we can have no Rea≈øon to hope that he will be <hi>better</hi> than his Word. For if after that he hath denounced, that if we per≈øi≈øt in our Sin he will puni≈øh us <hi>for ever</hi> for it, he ≈øhould have left us any <hi>ju≈øt</hi> Rea≈øon to hope that eh will not, he would thereby have countermined him≈øelf, and ba≈ø≈øled the De≈øign of his <hi>own</hi> Denunciation, which is to terrify his <hi>rebellious</hi> Creatures from their Sins, and to aw them into Obedience to his Laws. But how
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:154348:62"/>much Rea≈øon ≈øoever he hath given me to hope, that he will not be ≈øo <hi>≈øevere</hi> to me as he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, ≈øo much Rea≈øon he mu≈øt have given me not to be afraid of his Threatnings. If I had any <hi>ju≈øt</hi> Rea≈øon to believe that he will be more <hi>merciful</hi> than to inflict what he denounces, it is an <hi>irrational</hi> thing for me to dread his Denunciations; for I know <hi>God</hi> will do as <hi>just</hi> Rea≈øon directs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I mu≈øt conclude either my Rea≈øon to be <hi>fal≈øe,</hi> or God's Denunciation to be a <hi>Scare-crow;</hi> for if there be any <hi>ju≈øt</hi> Rea≈øon why his Mercy and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs ≈øhould interpo≈øe, and avert the Execution of his Threats from me, I ought not to be afraid of them, becau≈øe I am ≈øure he can do nothing that his Mercy and Goodne≈øs forbids: But if there be no Rea≈øon for ≈øuch an Interpo≈øure, I am unrea≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably <hi>pre≈øumptuous</hi> to expect it. So that either my Expectation mu≈øt be <hi>groundle≈øs,</hi> or my Fear of God's Threatnings <hi>irrational:</hi> And can it be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that the <hi>Wi≈øe</hi> God would ever go about to aw his Creatures into Obedience by threatning their Sin with ≈øuch Puni≈øhments as he knows they have <hi>just</hi> Rea≈øon not to be afradi of? What≈øoever therefore <hi>God</hi> may do, I am ≈øure if we go on in our Sins, we can have no Rea≈øon to hope that he will either not puni≈øh us at all, or <hi>le≈øs</hi> than he hath threatned; or con≈øequently, that he will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate us <hi>one</hi> moment of that <hi>eternal</hi> Mi≈øery which he hath ≈øo plainly and expre≈øly denounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt us.

So that it is but a very <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> while that the Plea≈øure of any <hi>outward</hi> Injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment continues; for till it hath plea≈øed us it is not a Plea≈øure, and when it hath, it cea≈øes to be ≈øo; and ≈øo it dies as ≈øoon as it is born, and its Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is only a <hi>Prelude</hi> to its Funeral. Thus all our Injoyments are ≈øtinted by our Appetites, which are naturally <hi>incapable</hi> of a <hi>continued</hi> Fruition.

Thus our Injoyment, like an Ague, is <hi>full</hi> of Intermi≈ø≈øions; now we are <hi>plea≈øed,</hi> and anon we are <hi>di≈øplea≈øed,</hi> and immediately after the <hi>hot Fit</hi> is over, the <hi>cold One</hi> returns; and thus it would be if we had all the World in our Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion. And indeed the Intervals of our Injoyment of the≈øe <hi>Terre≈øtrial</hi> Goods are u≈øually <hi>longer</hi> than the Injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ≈øelf, and the <hi>hot Fits</hi> of our Plea≈øure and Fruition are generally ≈øooner over, than tho≈øe <hi>cold Ones</hi> of Di≈øplea≈øure and Di≈ø≈øatisfaction that ≈øucceed them.

How then is it <hi>po≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> that ≈øuch a <hi>broken</hi> and <hi>di≈øcontinued</hi> Happine≈øs as this ≈øhould ever make us amends for tho≈øe Mi≈øeries that are included in the Lo≈øs of our Souls? For to lo≈øs our Souls is to be <hi>mi≈øerable</hi> without any Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, to be eternally grieved and tortured without any Intervals of Ea≈øe or Refre≈øhment.

               <p n="3">3. I now pa≈øs on to the <hi>third</hi> and <hi>la≈øt</hi> Thing, namely, what we are to under≈øtand by <hi>the Word's being made Fle≈øh?</hi> of which I ≈øhall give you a <hi>brief</hi> Account, and then conclude with a few ≈øhort Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences from the whole. Which Words, <hi>being made Fle≈øh,</hi> we ought not ≈øo to under≈øtand as if the <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Word</hi> was changed or converted into Fle≈øh, as <hi>Cerinthus</hi> taught; or as if the Fle≈øh was changed or
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:154348:85"/>converted into <hi>the Word,</hi> as <hi>Valentinus</hi> ridiculou≈øly a≈ø≈øerted; for the <hi>Deity</hi> is <hi>immutable,</hi> and as it can be changed into <hi>nothing,</hi> ≈øo <hi>nothing</hi> can be changed into it. But by <hi>Fle≈øh</hi> we are to under≈øtand <hi>Man,</hi> a <hi>Part</hi> being put for the <hi>Whole;</hi> for ≈øo the <hi>Scripture</hi> doth very frequently call Man <hi>Fle≈øh,</hi> that being <hi>one</hi> of the Ingredients of his Nature. Thus <hi>P≈ø.</hi> 56.4. <hi>I will not fear what fle≈øh can do unto me, Jerem.</hi> 17.5. <hi>Cur≈øed be the Man that maketh fle≈øh his arm,</hi> that is that puts his Confidence in Man: <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.22. <hi>Except tho≈øe days be ≈øhortned, no fle≈øh ≈øhall be ≈øaved;</hi> that is, no Man: And <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20. <hi>No fle≈øh ≈øhall be ju≈øtified in his ≈øight,</hi> that is, no Man ≈øhall be ju≈øtified. So here, <hi>The Word was made fle≈øh,</hi> that is <hi>The Word</hi> was made Man. Not that the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> was converted into the Nature of Man, but the Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, <hi>it</hi> was made <hi>one</hi> with Man, even as our <hi>Soul</hi> is not turned into nor confounded with the <hi>Body,</hi> yet they <hi>two,</hi> though <hi>di≈øtinct</hi> in Natures, grow into one Man; ≈øo the <hi>Manhood</hi> of <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> was a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øumed, or taken into <hi>The Word,</hi> both being uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into <hi>one</hi> Per≈øon, the Natures being pre≈øerved <hi>entire</hi> and <hi>di≈øtinct,</hi> without any Mixture or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øion. For as the <hi>Fourth General Council</hi> hath defined it, <hi>He was ≈øo made Fle≈øh that he cea≈øed not to be the Word, never changing that he was, but a≈ø≈øuming that which he was not.</hi> And though our <hi>Humanity</hi> was advanced by it, yet his <hi>Divinity</hi> was not at all dimini≈øhed; and the My≈øtery of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line≈øs, <hi>God manife≈øted in the fle≈øh,</hi> was no Detriment to the <hi>Godhead,</hi> which is always <hi>unchangeably</hi> the ≈øame: And therefore the <hi>≈øeeming</hi> Har≈øhne≈øs of this Expre≈ø≈øion may be ea≈øily molified by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring it with others of the ≈øame import; for el≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:154348:85"/>where it is ≈øaid, that <hi>he was manife≈øt in the fle≈øh,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. which only denotes that the <hi>Divinity</hi> was made known, and did appear in the World in a <hi>Humane Nature.</hi> El≈øewhere it is ≈øaid, that <hi>he took on him the Nature of Man, Heb.</hi> 2.16. which only denotes that the <hi>Divinity</hi> did a≈ø≈øume the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature</hi> to it, and was per≈øonally united with it. So here <hi>The Word was made fle≈øh; that is, The Word</hi> was made <hi>one</hi> with the Fle≈øh by a≈ø≈øuming the <hi>Humane Nature</hi> into a <hi>per≈øonal</hi> Union with it ≈øelf.</p>
               <p>Having thus explain'd to you the Sen≈øe and Meaning of the Words, I ≈øhall now conclude this Argument with <hi>three</hi> or <hi>four</hi> ≈øhort Inferences from the whole.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

For ≈øince it is ≈øo apparent that this Phra≈øe is a <hi>Term of Art</hi> derived from the <hi>Schools</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> and ≈øince by it they did all ≈øo generally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand a <hi>Divine Per≈øon</hi> ≈øub≈øi≈øting from all <hi>Eternity,</hi> it mu≈øt nece≈ø≈øarily follow that the <hi>Holy Gho≈øt,</hi> deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it from them and applying it to our <hi>Ble≈ø≈øed Saviour,</hi> mu≈øt u≈øe it to the <hi>≈øame</hi> Sen≈øe; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe He were better never to have u≈øed it at all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe by di≈øcour≈øing in the <hi>≈øame</hi> Language with them, he will give us <hi>ju≈øt</hi> occa≈øion to think that he means the <hi>≈øame</hi> thing, namely, that <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> whom he calls <hi>The Word,</hi> is a <hi>Divine</hi> Per≈øon ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øting from all <hi>Eternity;</hi> which if he doth not mean by u≈øing that Term, he will almo≈øt nece≈ø≈øarily betray us into a <hi>fal≈øe</hi> Belief concerning our <hi>Saviour.</hi> As, to in≈øtance briefly in a Ca≈øe of another Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:154348:86"/>Our <hi>Saviour</hi> in his Sermons doth frequently pre≈øs us to <hi>Meekne≈øs,</hi> and <hi>Patience, Humility</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> all which are <hi>Terms</hi> frequently u≈øed long before in the <hi>Moral Philo≈øophy</hi> both of the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> by which they ≈øignify fuch and fuch <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> Virtues. Since therefore our <hi>Saviour</hi> doth u≈øe the <hi>≈øame</hi> Terms with them, we have <hi>ju≈øt</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon to conclude that he mean the <hi>≈øame</hi> Virtues by them; and ≈øhould he mean any thing el≈øe, his very u≈øing of the≈øe Terms would nece≈ø≈øarily impo≈øe upon us a <hi>fal≈øe</hi> Sen≈øe of his meaning; for how ≈øhould we under≈øtand his Meaning but by his Words, and how ≈øhould we under≈øtand his Words but by the <hi>common</hi> Import and Signification of them? And can we imagine that the <hi>Spirit of Truth</hi> would have ven de≈øcribed our <hi>Saviour</hi> by a <hi>Term</hi> that was ≈øo generally u≈øed to ≈øignify a <hi>Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon</hi> ≈øub≈øi≈øting from all <hi>Eternity,</hi> and u≈øed it <hi>too,</hi> as he doth, without any Re≈øtraint or Limitation, nay and ≈øo ≈øeemingly at lea≈øt to the <hi>≈øame</hi> Purpo≈øe, as he doth in the <hi>three fir≈øt Ver≈øes</hi> of his Chapter, where he de≈øcribes the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> and <hi>Operations</hi> of <hi>Chri≈øt The Word,</hi> in the ≈øame terms in which the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> were wont to de≈øcribe the <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> of their ŒõŒüŒìŒüŒ£ can we imagine, I ≈øay, that the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> would have done thus, had he known <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> to be nothing but a <hi>meer</hi> Man that never was before he was born of his Mother?

               <p n="2">2. Hence I infer the <hi>a≈øtoni≈øhing</hi> Love of our <hi>Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed Saviour</hi> in conde≈øcending ≈øo low as to be made <hi>Fle≈øh</hi> for us, and a≈ø≈øume our Nature. For what he was before he took our Nature, you have heard
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:154348:86"/>already: He was no <hi>le≈øs</hi> than the <hi>Eternal Word of the Father;</hi> in who≈øe Bo≈øom he enjoyed the <hi>≈øupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me≈øt</hi> Degree of Bli≈øs and Happine≈øs, being crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Glory, and incircled about with the <hi>E≈ø≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> Rays of the <hi>Divinity.</hi> And yet ≈øuch was his Love to <hi>poor</hi> Mortals, ≈øo <hi>infinite</hi> was his Zeal and Concern for our Happine≈øs, that, ≈øeeing the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øery we were plunged into, he could not re≈øt, no not in the <hi>ble≈ø≈øed</hi> Arms of his Father, but ≈øtrip him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf of all his Maje≈øty and Bli≈øs, and comes down among us, and a≈ø≈øumes our Nature to ≈øave and re≈øcue us, and invite and lead us to tho≈øe <hi>Heavenly</hi> Man≈øions from whence he de≈øcended to us. Lord, what a <hi>Prodigy</hi> of Love was here, as doth not only <hi>puzzle</hi> my Conceit, but <hi>out-reach</hi> my Wonder and Admiration! For when I ≈øeriou≈øly con≈øider it, though it be a Ble≈ø≈øing beyond all my Hopes, and ≈øuch as I could never have had the Impudence to de≈øire; yet it fills my Mind with an <hi>awful</hi> Horror to think that there was a Time when the <hi>great</hi> God was here upon the Earth in my Form and Nature, and conver≈øed familiarly with ≈øuch <hi>mortal</hi> Wights as my ≈øelf, and for my ≈øake, and ≈øuch <hi>poor</hi> Worms as I, patiently under-went the <hi>common</hi> Infirmities of Men, and willingly expo≈øed him≈øelf to the Contempt and Scorn of a <hi>malevolent</hi> World, and the Malice and Cruelty of tho≈øe <hi>barbarous</hi> Men to whom he gave Being, and could with the Breath of his No≈øtrils have ≈øcattered into <hi>Atoms,</hi> and all this in <hi>meer</hi> Compa≈ø≈øion to a Company of <hi>apo≈øtatized</hi> Natures, who had ≈øo highly de≈øerved to be thrown from his Care and Mercy <hi>for ever.</hi> O my Soul, how am I a≈øtoni≈øhed at this <hi>Miracle</hi> of Love!

               <p n="3">3.

'Tis no great matter that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of you, 'tis only that you would be kind to your ≈øelves, that you would let Mi≈øery alone, and endeavour to be as happy as Heaven can make you.

And hence it is that the Well <hi>Lahi-roi,</hi> where the <hi>Angel</hi> appeared to <hi>Hagar, Gen.</hi> 16.7, 14. is by the <hi>Jeru≈øalem Targum,</hi> ≈øtiled the Well <hi>ubi manife≈øtata illi fuit Prae≈øentia Domini Maje≈øtatica, where the Pre≈øence of God in Maje≈øty was manife≈øted to her:</hi> And that <hi>vi≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Glory</hi> which appeared from between the Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims, is called by the ≈øame name <hi>viz,</hi> the <hi>Gloria Maje≈øtaticae prae≈øentiae Domini, the Glory of the Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtatick Pre≈øence of God;</hi> which is a <hi>plain</hi> Evidence that the <hi>Jews</hi> believed the <hi>Maje≈øtatick</hi> Pre≈øence of <hi>God</hi> to be nothing el≈øe but the Appearance of Angels. And of the ≈øame Mind was the <hi>Author to the Hebrews, Heb.</hi> 2.2. <hi>For the Law,</hi> ≈øaith he <hi>was ≈øpoken by Angels;</hi> and ≈øo St. <hi>Stephen, Acts</hi> 7.53. <hi>The Law was received by the Di≈øpo≈øition of Angels;</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that <hi>the Law was ordained by Angels in the hand of a Mediator, Galat.</hi> 3.19.

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:154348:92"/>and therefore where it is ≈øaid in <hi>I≈øaiah</hi>'s Vi≈øion, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 6.1. that <hi>he ≈øaw the Lord ≈øitting upon a Throne,</hi> and that <hi>his Train filled the Temple;</hi> that is, his Train of Angels; and this Train of Angels our <hi>Saviour</hi> calls <hi>the Glory of the Lord, Joh.</hi> 12.41. which is the ≈øame with the <hi>Shechinah,</hi> or <hi>Maje≈øtick Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence:</hi> And therefore perhaps they are called <hi>Angels of Light</hi> in reference to that <hi>lucid, ≈øhining, flaming</hi> Appearance which they were wont to make: And in <hi>P≈ø.</hi> 104.4. <hi>God</hi> is ≈øaid <hi>to make his Mini≈øters a flaming fire,</hi> that is, when they are to make a vi≈øible Repre≈øentation of his <hi>Maje≈øtick Pre≈øence</hi> to Mankind.

And if this be ≈øo, as it ≈øeems high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly probable, that <hi>The Word</hi> was <hi>the Angel of God's Pre≈øence,</hi> that is, the <hi>Chief</hi> or <hi>Prince</hi> of tho≈øe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels that repre≈øented <hi>God</hi> in the World, then it will follow that the <hi>Shechinah,</hi> or <hi>Maje≈øtick Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence</hi> of God, con≈øi≈øted in a <hi>glorious</hi> and <hi>vi≈øible</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of <hi>the Word</hi> with a Troop of <hi>ble≈ø≈øed</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels attending him in <hi>bright</hi> and <hi>luminous</hi> Forms. And this I conceive was the <hi>glorious Pre≈øence</hi> of God which came down fir≈øt upon <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards removed into the Tabernacle, and abode between the two Cherubims. And this I am ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther induced to believe, becau≈øe I find the De≈øcent of God's Pre≈øence upon <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> is de≈øcribed in the ≈øame manner as Chri≈øt's coming to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for ≈øo, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.27. it is ≈øaid, that <hi>he ≈øhall come in the Glory of his Father, with his Angels;</hi> and St. <hi>Jude</hi> tells us, that <hi>he ≈øhall come with his holy Myriads, or Ten Thou≈øands, v.</hi> 14. for ≈øo it ought to be render'd: And the Lord in the ≈øame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:154348:94"/>is ≈øaid to come from <hi>Sinai with his holy Ten Thou≈øands, or Myriads;</hi> for ≈øo it is in the <hi>Hebrew, Deut.</hi> 33.2. And ≈øince they are both de≈øcribed in the ≈øame manner, it ≈øeems to follow, that they were both the <hi>≈øame Maje≈øtick Pre≈øence</hi> of God, even the <hi>Eternal Word</hi> a≈ø≈øuming a <hi>glorious</hi> Form, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with <hi>Myriads</hi> of <hi>bright</hi> and <hi>≈øhining</hi> Angels. And this ≈øame <hi>Pre≈øence</hi> it was that was afterwards di≈øplayed in the Tabernacle, which was ≈øaid to be filled with the <hi>Glory of the Lord,</hi> which ≈øhone from between the Cherubims with a <hi>bright</hi> and <hi>vi≈øible</hi> Splendour, that is, with the <hi>illu≈øtrious</hi> Appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the <hi>Eternal Word,</hi> and tho≈øe <hi>glorious</hi> Angels that attended him. And upon <hi>that</hi> Mount, and in <hi>that</hi> Tabernacle, did this <hi>ble≈ø≈øed Word</hi> repre≈øent his Father, even as the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> doth the <hi>Sovereign</hi> Prince; for there in his Father's Per≈øon, and by his Authority, he gave forth his Laws and Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and as the Vice-ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of the mo≈øt <hi>High God</hi> governed the Hou≈øe of <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> and di≈øtributed to them <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Puni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> according as they behaved them≈øelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him: For upon all the <hi>fore-named</hi> Rea≈øons it ≈øeems highly probable, that he was the Lord who ≈øpoke to <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> and from between the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims, and that thence delivered the Law to him. So that as he was the <hi>Shechinah,</hi> or <hi>glorious Pre≈øence</hi> of the mo≈øt <hi>High God</hi> in the Tabernacle, he did there repre≈øent his Per≈øon by bearing his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and ruling the Hou≈øe of <hi>I≈ørael</hi> as his <hi>Sub≈øtitute</hi> and <hi>Vice-Roy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that the Words of my Text do refer to this <hi>glorious</hi> Appearance of <hi>the Word</hi> in the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, and to his repre≈øenting of the mo≈øt <hi>High
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:154348:95"/>God</hi> there, is very evident, in that it is not only ≈øaid that he tabernacled among them, which evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently alludes to his dwelling in the <hi>old</hi> Tabernacle, but that they ≈øaw <hi>his Glory</hi> too, which is a <hi>plain</hi> Allu≈øion to that Glory of his which filled the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle. So that the Meaning of the≈øe Words, <hi>He dwelt among us,</hi> ≈øeems to be this, that as <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> who is the <hi>Eternal Word,</hi> was the <hi>Shechinah, the Divine Pre≈øence,</hi> or <hi>Angel of God's Pre≈øence,</hi> which in the Tabernacle of <hi>old</hi> repre≈øented the mo≈øt <hi>High</hi> to the <hi>Jews;</hi> ≈øo he al≈øo abode or tabernacled in our Fle≈øh as the <hi>Repre≈øentative</hi> of his Father to Mankind.

So that, <hi>He dwelt among us,</hi> ≈øeems to ≈øignify the ≈øame with, He reigned among us in his Father's ≈øtead, as one who bore his Authority, and repre≈øented his Per≈øon, and to whom for the future we were to pay the <hi>≈øame</hi> Homage and Reverence that we were bound to render to the mo≈øt <hi>High</hi> him≈øelf, who under <hi>him≈øelf</hi> hath authorized him to be our Prince and Governour to declare his Divine Will to us, and exact our Obedience thereunto by <hi>rewarding</hi> and <hi>puni≈øhing</hi> us according to the Tenour of tho≈øe Laws

The <hi>Jews</hi> being a mo≈øt <hi>≈øtubborn</hi> and <hi>≈øtiff-necked</hi> Generation, (as they are often called in the <hi>Old Te≈øtament</hi>) the <hi>Eternal Word</hi> thought fit to conver≈øe among them in ≈øuch a way as was mo≈øt <hi>≈øuitable</hi> to their <hi>Genius</hi> and Temper, to break their Stubbornne≈øs with the Dread of his Power, and awe them with the Terror of his Maje≈øty.

And ≈øo I have done with the fir≈øt Note of Di≈øtinction between Chri≈øt's dwelling among <hi>us,</hi> and his dwelling in the <hi>Mo≈øaick Tabernacle:</hi> He dwelt among us <hi>full of Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>other</hi> Character by which his dwelling among <hi>us</hi> is di≈øtingui≈øhed from his dwelling in the <hi>Mo≈øaick Tabernacle,</hi> is this, that he dwelt among us <hi>full of Truth.</hi> It's <hi>plain</hi> that <hi>Truth</hi> here is not to
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:154348:103"/>be under≈øtood as oppo≈øed to <hi>Fal≈øhood,</hi> becau≈øe in that Sen≈øe it is no Note of Di≈øtinction between the≈øe <hi>two</hi> Dwellings or Tabernaclings of <hi>Christ,</hi> unle≈øs we ≈øuppo≈øe that he did fal≈øly dwell, or act, and repre≈øent <hi>God</hi> in the Tabernacle of <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> which would be to bla≈øpheme his Truth and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity. <hi>Truth</hi> therefore mu≈øt here be under≈øtood as oppo≈øed to <hi>Ob≈øcurity</hi> and <hi>Shadow,</hi> and ≈øo mu≈øt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note <hi>Clearne≈øs</hi> and <hi>Reality,</hi> as it very commonly doth. As when we ≈øay a Picture is not a <hi>true</hi> Man, we do not charge the Picture with a Lye; if it could ≈øpeak indeed, and ≈øhould call it ≈øelf a Man, we ≈øhould then ≈øay it were a <hi>lying</hi> Picture for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to be what it is not, being only a <hi>≈øilent</hi> Re≈øemblance of him. Thus when the <hi>Apo≈øtle</hi> ≈øaith, <hi>He dwelt among us full of Truth,</hi> and thereby di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øhes his tabernacling among <hi>us</hi> from the manner of his dwelling among the <hi>Jews,</hi> it is not ≈øo to be under≈øtood as if he had dwelt among them in a <hi>fal≈øe</hi> or <hi>lying</hi> manner, or that <hi>that</hi> Repre≈øentation which he made to them of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Divine</hi> Things were <hi>fal≈øe</hi> and <hi>impo≈øturous;</hi> no, God forbid: But thus, whereas when He inhabited the Tabernacle, he was <hi>full</hi> of <hi>Hieroglyphicks,</hi> or <hi>my≈øtical</hi> Repre≈øenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which though they were <hi>true</hi> Pictures or Shadows of <hi>Divine</hi> Things, yet have not the Truth and Reality of the Things them≈øelves in them, and con≈øequently would be Lies and Cheats ≈øhould they pretend to be what they only repre≈øent; but now he is come to dwell among us, he is <hi>full</hi> of the Things them≈øelves, of tho≈øe <hi>Realities</hi> which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly he only gave us the <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Shadows</hi> of; now he hath removed all that Scene of Pictures and <hi>my≈øtical</hi> Repre≈øentations, and brought the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:154348:104"/>Things them≈øelves upon the <hi>Stage,</hi> and expo≈øed them <hi>naked</hi> to the View of the World. So that <hi>now</hi> he doth not entertain <hi>us,</hi> as <hi>heretofore</hi> he did the <hi>Jews,</hi> with <hi>Emblems</hi> and <hi>Shadows,</hi> but with Truth, and the <hi>real</hi> Sub≈øtances of Things. And thus the Word is very frequently taken in the <hi>New Te≈øtament:</hi> Thus, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.2. the <hi>Chri≈øtian Church</hi> is called <hi>the true Tabernacle,</hi> in Contradi≈øtinction to the <hi>Tabernacle of Mo≈øes;</hi> not as if <hi>that</hi> were a <hi>fal≈øe</hi> Tabernacle, but a <hi>typical</hi> one, it being de≈øign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only as a Shadow of the <hi>Chri≈øtian Church,</hi> which is the <hi>true</hi> Reality and Sub≈øtance which was pictured and repre≈øented in it; for ≈øo the <hi>Apo≈øtle</hi> him≈øelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24. <hi>For Chri≈øt,</hi> ≈øaith he, <hi>is not entred into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true, but into Heaven it ≈øelf:</hi> From whence it's plain, that therefore tho≈øe <hi>Holy Places</hi> are oppo≈øed to <hi>true Places,</hi> becau≈øe they were only Figures, or <hi>my≈øtical</hi> Repre≈øentations of ≈øomething that is <hi>real</hi> and <hi>≈øub≈øtantial.</hi> So, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.16. when <hi>Daniel</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øired to know the Truth of that <hi>Prophetick Scene,</hi> it is ≈øaid, that <hi>One ≈øtood by, and made him know the Interpretation of the things;</hi> that is, what was the Reality and Sub≈øtance that was repre≈øented in tho≈øe Types and Figures. So here, <hi>He dwelt among us full of Truth,</hi> that is, when he dwelt among us he was <hi>full</hi> of the <hi>Sub≈øtance</hi> and <hi>Reality</hi> of tho≈øe Things which before he was wont to repre≈øent by <hi>ob≈øcure Emblems</hi> and <hi>Shadows;</hi> now he pre≈øents to us the Things them≈øelves, and not the <hi>my≈øtical</hi> Types and Figures of them as formerly he was wont to do. For I think it's very evident, that the <hi>whole</hi> Model of the <hi>Jewi≈øh Polity</hi> was purpo≈øely contrived to be an <hi>Emblem</hi> and Repre≈øentation of the <hi>Go≈øpel,</hi> and
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:154348:104"/>that the <hi>main</hi> Rea≈øon of tho≈øe <hi>numerous</hi> Rites and Ceremonies, was to delineate and ≈øhadow out the <hi>glorious</hi> My≈øteries of <hi>Chri≈øtianity:</hi> For the Apo≈øtle plainly tells us, that they were all a <hi>≈øhadow of things to come,</hi> and that <hi>the Body,</hi> or Sub≈øtance of that Shadow, <hi>was Je≈øus Chri≈øt, Col.</hi> 2.17. And the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> calls them <hi>the Patterns of the things in Heaven,</hi> or the <hi>heavenly</hi> Things; by which it's plain he means <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> or the Subjects of the Kingdom of <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> ≈øince he tells us that as it was <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> that tho≈øe Patterns ≈øhould be purified with Blood, ≈øo it was <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> that tho≈øe <hi>Heavenly</hi> Things repre≈øented by them, ≈øhould be purified by a <hi>better Sacrifice, Heb.</hi> 9.23. And what other <hi>Heavenly</hi> Things are there but only <hi>Chri≈øtians</hi> that are purified with this <hi>better Sacrifice</hi> of Chri≈øt? And in another place the ≈øame Author tells us, that <hi>the Law hath in it a Shadow of good things to come, Heb.</hi> 10.1. And thus very frequently in the <hi>New Te≈øtament,</hi> the <hi>≈øacred</hi> Rites of the <hi>Mo≈øaick Law</hi> are declared to be Types and Shadows of the <hi>My≈øteries</hi> of the <hi>Go≈øpel,</hi> as particlarly in the Epi≈øtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> which is almo≈øt wholly ≈øpent upon this Argument, And this the <hi>Jews</hi> them≈øelves ≈øeem to be acquainted with long before the Publication of the <hi>Go≈øpel:</hi> For ≈øo the mo≈øt ancient <hi>Jews</hi> look'd upon the Temple as a Type and Figure of the <hi>Heavenly</hi> State; and <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> in his <hi>Allegories of the Law,</hi> and almo≈øt in all his <hi>other</hi> Writings, makes the Rites and Ceremonies of the <hi>Mo≈øaick</hi> Law to be Types and Figures of ≈øome <hi>Divine</hi> or <hi>Moral</hi> Truth, and particularly the <hi>High Prie≈øt</hi> to be an <hi>Emblem</hi> of the <hi>Eternal Word,</hi> and his Crown and Ve≈øtments to be Repre≈øentations of <hi>his</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:154348:105"/>and <hi>Divine</hi> Perfections, wherein he exactly agrees with the Author to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> And from <hi>≈øundry</hi> Pa≈ø≈øages in the <hi>Book of P≈øalms</hi> it ≈øeems evident, that the <hi>good Jews</hi> had a Pro≈øpect beyond the <hi>Out≈øide</hi> and Letter of the Law, even into the <hi>typical</hi> Sen≈øe and Meaning of it; and that through its <hi>glimmering</hi> Shadows and Re≈øemblances, they beheld very much of the Sub≈øtance and Realities of the <hi>Go≈øpel:</hi> For hence probably was that of <hi>David, P≈ø.</hi> 25.14. <hi>The Secret of the Lord is with them that fear him;</hi> for certainly the <hi>Secret of the Lord</hi> here cannot be meant the <hi>Fore-knowledge</hi> of <hi>future Events,</hi> ≈øince under the <hi>Old Te≈øtament</hi> that was neither re≈øtrained to <hi>good</hi> Men, nor much <hi>le≈øs</hi> was it univer≈øally with them that feared <hi>God;</hi> and therefore it ≈øeems more probable, that by <hi>it</hi> we are to under≈øtand tho≈øe <hi>then ≈øecret</hi> My≈øteries of the <hi>Go≈øpel,</hi> which were ≈øo ob≈øcurely repre≈øented in the Types and Figures of the <hi>Law;</hi> e≈øpecially if we compare this with that Prayer of <hi>David, P≈øalm</hi> 119.18. <hi>Open thou mine Eyes that I may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the wondrous things out of thy Law;</hi> which me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks plainly intimates that the <hi>good</hi> Man did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there were ≈øome <hi>wondrous</hi> My≈øteries contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under tho≈øe <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>typical</hi> Repre≈øentations: And afterwards, <hi>v.</hi> 27. <hi>make me to under≈øtand the way of thy Precepts, ≈øo ≈øhall I talk of thy wondrous Works;</hi> which implies that he believed that there were ≈øome Things very <hi>my≈øtical</hi> and <hi>hard</hi> to be under≈øtood contained within the Precepts of their Law, which in their <hi>literal</hi> Sen≈øe were <hi>ea≈øy</hi> and <hi>obvious,</hi> and had nothing of Depths or My≈øtery in them; and therefore certainly had he not ≈øeen ≈øomething within them beyond their Rine and

                  <hi>wicked</hi> Manners of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> it is not to be ≈øuppo≈øed that they were Subjects capable of the Heights and Purities of <hi>Religion;</hi> for if from the <hi>Depth</hi> of <hi>Immorality,</hi> whereinto they were ≈øunk, <hi>God</hi> ≈øhould have immediately ≈øtrained them up to the <hi>highest</hi> Pitch of <hi>Go≈øpel-Purity,</hi> in all Probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they would never have born it; but like the Strings of a <hi>Mu≈øical In≈øtrument,</hi> being wound <hi>too high,</hi> would have been apt to crack and fly in pieces, and wholly to revolt from <hi>God</hi> into tho≈øe <hi>gro≈øs</hi> Idolatries which yet they were hardly wean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from, and which were ≈øtill ≈øo <hi>≈øuitable</hi> to their Genius and Temper.

So that you ≈øee the State and Condition
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:154348:107"/>of the <hi>Jews</hi> would not admit of a plain Di≈øcovery of the <hi>Go≈øpel</hi> to them, but required an <hi>outward Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Religion, that</hi> being mo≈øt <hi>accommodate</hi> to their Genius and Temper; and therefore though the <hi>Eternal Word</hi> for the <hi>pre≈øent</hi> Exigence e≈øtabli≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ≈øuch a <hi>Religion</hi> among them, yet He wi≈øely framed and modelled it into a <hi>typical</hi> Repre≈øenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Go≈øpel,</hi> that ≈øo thereby he might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them for it, and ≈øo far in≈øtruct them in the Knowledge of it as was <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> to their Welfare and Happine≈øs.

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:154348:108"/>them, as you may find it demon≈øtrated at large in the Epi≈øtle to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> For as to the <hi>High Priest,</hi> he was <hi>to be called, and ordained of God, Heb.</hi> 5.4. in which the <hi>Eternal Word</hi> repre≈øented to them his Commi≈ø≈øion from the Father, to de≈øcend into the World as his <hi>Emba≈ø≈øador</hi> to Men. <hi>Secondly,</hi> He was to be born of a Woman that came a <hi>pure Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin</hi> into the Arms of his Father, <hi>Levit.</hi> 21.14. in which he ≈øeems to repre≈øent to them his own <hi>pure</hi> Nativity of a <hi>Virgin-Mother. Thirdly,</hi> He was to be wa≈øhed with Water, and his Fle≈øh and Loyns were to be covered with the <hi>whitest</hi> and the <hi>clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est</hi> linnen, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.7. and 28.42. by which Chri≈øt <hi>typified</hi> to them the <hi>IMMAC<g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>LATE</hi> San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity and Innocence of his <hi>humane</hi> Life. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He was to be clothed in the mo≈øt <hi>glorious</hi> Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that could po≈ø≈øibly be made by the mo≈øt <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent</hi> Workmen, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.2, 3. which ≈øeems to denote the <hi>Maje≈øty</hi> of Chri≈øt's Per≈øon, and tho≈øe <hi>glorious</hi> Works by which he render'd him≈øelf ≈øo <hi>illu≈øtrious</hi> in the World. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The Colours of the <hi>Embroideries</hi> of his Garment being <hi>blue, purple, ≈øcarlet,</hi> and <hi>white,</hi> ≈øeem to denote the <hi>Truth</hi> of his <hi>Prophetick Office,</hi> the <hi>Maje≈øty</hi> of his <hi>Royal,</hi> the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> of his <hi>Prie≈øtly,</hi> and his <hi>Innocence</hi> and <hi>Sanctity</hi> in the Execution of them all. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> He wore a <hi>holy Crown</hi> on his Head, and a <hi>Plate</hi> on his Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head engraven with <hi>Holine≈øs;</hi> which denotes the <hi>Divine</hi> Authority of <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> and the <hi>Sacredne≈øs</hi> and <hi>Divinity</hi> of his Per≈øon. And, <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Upon his Brea≈øt he wore the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> in which was prefigured the <hi>Height</hi> and <hi>Purity</hi> of Chri≈øt's Doctrine, and the <hi>Holine≈øs</hi> and <hi>Perfection</hi> of his Laws. In a word, the <hi>High Priest</hi> was to offer
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:154348:108"/>Sacrifice for the Sins of the People, on the <hi>great day of Expiation,</hi> which Sacrifice was to be a <hi>Bea≈øt without blemi≈øh</hi> voluntarily pre≈øented at the Door of the Tabernacle, whither the <hi>High Priest</hi> being come, he was to ≈øtrip <hi>off</hi> his <hi>glorious</hi> Garment, to lay his Hand on the Head of the Bea≈øt, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øs the Peoples Sins over it, and then to ≈ølay the Bea≈øt, and carry ≈øome of the Blood of it within the <hi>Vail,</hi> and ≈øprinkle it upon, and before the <hi>Mercy-Seat,</hi> by which he is ≈øaid to make an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement for their Sins; that is, to obtain Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from God to ble≈øs and pardon: In which the <hi>Eternal Word</hi> gives us a plain Repre≈øentation of his <hi>future Sacrifice</hi> upon <hi>Earth,</hi> and <hi>Interce≈ø≈øion</hi> in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi> for he being both our <hi>Sacrifice</hi> and <hi>High Priest,</hi> did freely dive≈øt him≈øelf of the Glory and Dignity of his <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> and offer up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf to die for us; by which he laid his Hand as it were upon his own <hi>≈øpotle≈øs</hi> and <hi>immaculate</hi> Head, did as our <hi>Repre≈øentative</hi> acknowledge what we had de≈øerved, that for our Sins we have ju≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly merited to die <hi>for ever</hi> by the Hand of <hi>God,</hi> even as He for our ≈øakes did ≈øubmit to die by the Hand of Man: And having performed this <hi>bloody Sacrifice,</hi> he enters into <hi>Heaven,</hi> which is the true <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> and there by the Oblation of his Blood and Obedience, makes an Attonement for our Sins, and obtains Authority from his Father to pardon and receive into Favour every truly <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent</hi> Offender in the World. Thus you ≈øee how the <hi>Per≈øonal Tran≈øactions</hi> of our <hi>Saviour</hi> were under the Law of <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> repre≈øented in <hi>my≈øtical</hi> Types and Figures; but when he came to tabernacle among <hi>us,</hi> he did all <hi>that</hi> which before he only repre≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:154348:109"/>He actually came down from the Father to us, was born of the <hi>Holy Virgin,</hi> lived a mo≈øt <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>innocent</hi> Life, died a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for our Sins, and is gone into <hi>Heaven</hi> to intercede for us: So that now in≈øtead of <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Figures,</hi> we have the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances</hi> and <hi>Realities</hi> that were ob≈øcurely ≈øhadowed and repre≈øented in them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another <hi>great</hi> In≈øtance of his conver≈øing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us <hi>full of Truth,</hi> is the <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Spirituality</hi> of his Laws. It's <hi>apparent</hi> that tho≈øe which he gave to the <hi>Jews,</hi> according to the <hi>literal</hi> Sen≈øe of them, did only oblige them to an <hi>External Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</hi> and therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls the whole Law a <hi>carnal Commandment, Heb.</hi> 7.16. and the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of it he calls <hi>carnal Ordinances impo≈øed upon them till the time of Reformation, Heb.</hi> 9.10. But yet it is apparent that by the≈øe <hi>carnal Ordinances</hi> the <hi>Eternal Word</hi> did de≈øignedly <hi>typify</hi> and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent that <hi>internal</hi> Purity of Soul which the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Law</hi> doth exact: For he ≈øeeing that the <hi>Jews</hi> were not only a <hi>perver≈øe,</hi> but al≈øo a <hi>dull</hi> and <hi>≈øotti≈øh</hi> People, as tho≈øe generally are who are born and bred in Slavery, and that therefore they were <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable</hi> of <hi>≈øublime</hi> and <hi>≈øpiritual</hi> Precepts, and would be apt to forget <hi>plain</hi> ones, He therefore thought it mo≈øt proper and ≈øuitable to their Capacity and Genius to in≈øtruct them by <hi>≈øen≈øible</hi> and <hi>material</hi> Signs, even as Parents do ≈øometimes teach their Children by Pictures; for of this his Conde≈øcenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to their Dulne≈øs and Capacity, the Prophet <hi>I≈øaiah</hi> takes notice, <hi>Chap.</hi> 28.10, 11. where he ≈øaith, that he gave them <hi>precept upon precept, line upon line, here a little and there a little with a ≈øtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering tongue;</hi> that is, he look'd upon them as Children, and ≈øo conde≈øcended to their Weakne≈øs,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:154348:109"/>and ≈øpoke to them in their <hi>own</hi> Dialect. And this Way of in≈øtructing them by <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>vi≈øible</hi> Signs was the mo≈øt <hi>probable</hi> to take effect, becau≈øe it was much in u≈øe in the <hi>Ea≈øtern Countries,</hi> but more e≈øpecially in <hi>Egypt,</hi> who≈øe Manners they were infinitely fond of, to wrap up their mo≈øt <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent</hi> Precepts in <hi>Hieroglyphicks,</hi> which were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Pictures and <hi>material</hi> Sings, by which they repre≈øented their <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Moral</hi> In≈øtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Thus therefore by ≈øuch <hi>vi≈øible</hi> Signs and Pictures, the <hi>Eternal Word</hi> in≈øtructed them in the Rules of <hi>internal</hi> Purity and Goodne≈øs; ≈øo by <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumci≈øion</hi> he ≈øignified to them the Circumci≈øion of their Hearts; and by their <hi>≈øeveral Wa≈øhings,</hi> Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from <hi>Hypocri≈øy</hi> and <hi>Sen≈øuality;</hi> yea this was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably the Intent of that Difference of <hi>Meats,</hi> as St. <hi>Barnabas</hi> in his Epi≈øtle tells us, that Swines Fle≈øh was pronounc'd <hi>unclean,</hi> to in≈øtruct them not to live like <hi>Hoggs</hi> that clamour when they are <hi>hungry,</hi> and forget their Ma≈øters when they are <hi>full;</hi> that <hi>Eagles,</hi> and ≈øuch <hi>ravenous Birds</hi> were forbidden to be eat, to teach them that tho≈øe who live not by <hi>Indu≈øtry,</hi> but <hi>Rapine,</hi> are <hi>abominable;</hi> that <hi>Fi≈øh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Scales,</hi> which generally dwell in the Mud, were all pronounced <hi>unclean;</hi> to teach them the Evil of <hi>Sen≈øuality,</hi> and <hi>Earthly-mindedne≈øs!</hi> Thus by the≈øe <hi>outward</hi> Signs his Intent was to in≈øinuate into them <hi>internal</hi> Purity of Mind; and this was very well under≈øtood by tho≈øe who were <hi>good</hi> and <hi>wi≈øe</hi> among them: Hence we find <hi>David</hi> gives very <hi>high En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comiums</hi> of the Law, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 19.7, 8. <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect, converting the Soul, making wi≈øe the ≈øimple; rejoycing the Heart, enlightning the Eyes,</hi> &amp;c. which Characters are <hi>proper</hi> only to that <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>

Which Sen≈øe ≈øeems to have been very <hi>little</hi> taken notice of by the <hi>≈øotti≈øh Vulgar;</hi> for only the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony it ≈øelf was Matter of Law to them, which if they ob≈øerved they were not <hi>puni≈øhable</hi> by that Law, though they never took notice of its <hi>≈øpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> Sen≈øe and Meaning, which made them neglect that <hi>inward</hi> Purity which was pictured on tho≈øe <hi>outward</hi> Signs, and place the whole of their Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teou≈øne≈øs in an <hi>out≈øide ceremonious</hi> Pageantry. Hence is that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 3.13, 14, 15. <hi>I u≈øed,</hi> ≈øaith he, <hi>great plainne≈øs of Speech: And not as Mo≈øes, which put a Vail over his Face, that the Children of I≈ørael could not ≈øtedfa≈øtly look unto the end of that which is aboli≈øhed.

Another In≈øtance of his tabernacling among us <hi>full of Truth,</hi> in Contradi≈øtinction to that <hi>ob≈øcure typical</hi> Way of his conver≈øing among the <hi>Jews,</hi> is the Condition and Quality of his <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> The <hi>Eternal Word,</hi> de≈øigning to erect a <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> Kingdom in the World, drew as it were a <hi>rude</hi> Scheme or Draught of it in the Form and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of the <hi>Jewi≈øh Polity.</hi> For <hi>first</hi> he erects a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom among them of which him≈øelf was King, to typify the <hi>Spiritual</hi> Kingdom which afterwards he meant to e≈øtabli≈øh in the World; then he adopts the <hi>Jews</hi> to be his Children by the <hi>external</hi> Sign of <hi>Circumci≈øion,</hi> who are therefore called a <hi>Holy Seed,</hi> which was an Emblem of that <hi>Holy Seed</hi> which afterwards he de≈øigned to beget to him≈øelf by <hi>≈øpiritual</hi> Regeneration, which is therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Circumci≈øion of the Heart, who≈øe Prai≈øe is not of Men, but of God.</hi> His delivering them from the Bondage of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and leading them through the <hi>Red-Sea</hi> and the Wilderne≈øs into <hi>Canaan,</hi> typified his delivering of his <hi>future Church</hi> from the Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of Sin and Satan, and leading it by his own

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:154348:113"/>≈øhould he have come down from <hi>Heaven</hi> in his own Per≈øon to give Laws to Mankind. For ≈øo when the <hi>Eternal Word</hi> went before the Camp of <hi>I≈ørael</hi> as the <hi>Shechinah,</hi> or <hi>Angel of God's Pre≈øence,</hi> God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires them that they ≈øhould obey <hi>him</hi> as him≈øelf; <hi>Beware of him, and obey his Voice,</hi> ≈øaith God; <hi>provoke him not, for he will not pardon your Tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion, for my Name is in him,</hi> Exod. 23.21. and <hi>v.</hi> 22. To obey the Voice of this <hi>Angel</hi> is interpreted to be the ≈øame thing, as to obey the Voice of the mo≈øt <hi>High God</hi> him≈øelf; <hi>But if thou ≈øhalt indeed obey his Voice,</hi> ≈øaith God, <hi>and do all that I ≈øpeak, then I will be an Enemy to thy Enemies,</hi> &amp;c. So that for the <hi>I≈øraelites</hi> to di≈øobey this <hi>Angel</hi> (who, as I have proved to you, was the <hi>Eternal Word,</hi> or <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øentative</hi> of the mo≈øt <hi>High God</hi> to them) was to all Intents and Purpo≈øes the ≈øame Thing as if they had di≈øobeyed the mo≈øt <hi>High</hi> him≈øelf. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly our <hi>Saviour</hi> tells the <hi>Jews, He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth on me, believeth not on me but on the Father that ≈øent me;</hi> that is, he doth not meerly believe on me, but on the Father <hi>too,</hi> who≈øe Authority I have, and who≈øe Per≈øon I reprefent; for ≈øo he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains him≈øelf in the <hi>following</hi> Ver≈øe, <hi>He that ≈øeeth me, ≈øeeth him that ≈øent me;</hi> that is, I being my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's <hi>Shechinah,</hi> or <hi>Repre≈øentative, Joh.</hi> 12.44, 45.

                  <hi>Why, Lord, we know that thou wer't an au≈øtere Man, that thou would'≈øt exact of us to the utmo≈øt Punctilio, and that if ever we fail'd in the lea≈øt Circum≈øtance of our Duty thou would'≈øt immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately let loo≈øe thy implacable Vengeance upon us, and this utterly di≈øheartned us from thy Service con≈øidering how impo≈ø≈øible it was for us to plea≈øe thee.</hi>

                  <hi>But, Lord, the Laws which thou gave≈øt us were ≈øo intolerably burthen, ≈øom that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we nor our Fore-fathers were able to bear them: We would willingly have obeyed thee if it had been po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible, but when we ≈øaw thy Burthen exceeded our Strength, we concluded it was in vain for us to attempt the bearing it.</hi>

                  <q>Ah <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy</hi> Wretches! with what Confidence can you impute the Continuation of your Rebellion again≈øt me to your De≈øpair of ever finding Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy at my hands, when you know in <hi>your own</hi> Con≈øciences that I died to procure Forgivene≈øs for you, and that by my Death I obtained an Act of <hi>Indemnity</hi> and <hi>Oblivion</hi> for all that would come in, and return to their Duty upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation of my <hi>Go≈øpel?</hi> When you cannot but know that I tender'd you your Pardon ≈øealed with <hi>my own</hi> Blood, and courted you to accept of it; and though time after time you ≈øcornfully refu≈øed and rejected it, yet in hope that at la≈øt you might be prevailed with, you know how long I waited upon you even till you had tired out my Patience, and I ≈øaw there was no Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? And do you now charge your not return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your Duty upon your Hopele≈øne≈øs of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for your <hi>former</hi> Rebellions?</q> 
                  <hi>'Tis true, Lord, we cannot deny but thou did≈øt offer us Pardon; but, alas, it was upon an impo≈ø≈øible Condition, even upon a hearty Repentance, and a thorough Reformation, which thou knewe≈øt we were not then able to perform. For by
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:154348:124"/>a long Cu≈øtom of Rebellion again≈øt thee, we had contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted ≈øo many inveterate evil Habits, which had ≈øo weaken'd and debilitated our Powers, that we were no more able to reform and amend our ≈øelves than the Leopard is to change his Spots, or the Aethiopian his Skin: To what Purpo≈øe then ≈øhould we attempt Impo≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, or ≈øet our ≈øelves to wre≈øtle with Difficulties which we knew we wre never able to ≈øurmount?</hi> 
                  <q>But pray, how did you know that it was <hi>impo≈ø≈øible</hi> for you to repent when by all the Arguments I u≈øed with you, I could never per≈øuade you to make Trail of it? You know in <hi>your own</hi> Con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences that there are <hi>many</hi> things that you could do; you could have betaken your ≈øelves to a <hi>≈øerious</hi> Con≈øideration of the Duties and Motives of <hi>Religion;</hi> you could have attended, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtained at lea≈øt from the <hi>outward</hi> Acts of Sin, and humbly implored my Grace and A≈ø≈øi≈øtance; and that to encourage you to do this, and what el≈øe was in your Power, I gave you the mo≈øt <hi>ample</hi> A≈ø≈øurance in the World that I would <hi>back</hi> and <hi>enforce</hi> your Endeavours with the Aids of my Grace, and in de≈øpite of all oppo≈øition crown them with Succe≈øs. So that though by your own <hi>≈øingle</hi> Strength indeed you could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have effected your Repentance, yet it was far from being <hi>impo≈ø≈øible</hi> to you, ≈øince you knew that by doing what was in your power, you ≈øhould infallibly oblige me to enable you to do all the re≈øt.</q> 
                  <hi>But, ble≈ø≈øed Lord, what Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had we to repent and return to our Duty? for if we had done it, we mu≈øt have bid adieu for ever to all tho≈øe Plea≈øures and Delights by which we were invited and detained in the Service of our Lu≈øts; and Thou
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:154348:125"/>offered'≈øt us nothing in exchange for them, but only Sighs and Tears, with other ungrateful Rigours of a bitter and ≈øevere Repentance. How then can≈øt thou blame our Di≈øobedience again≈øt thee, when we had ≈øo many inviting Temptations to it, and ≈øo little Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to the contrary?</hi> 
                  <q>O <hi>prodigious</hi> Impudence! with what Face can you a≈ø≈øert ≈øuch a <hi>notorious</hi> Fal≈øhood when you know in your <hi>own</hi> Con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences that be≈øides all tho≈øe Plea≈øures that are <hi>connatural</hi> to my Service, and which do va≈øtly exceed all the Plea≈øures of Sin, I laid an <hi>immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> Crown at your Feet, and faithfully promi≈øed you that if you would but ≈øpend a <hi>≈øhort</hi> Life in my Service, I would at the End of it receive you into that <hi>bli≈øsful</hi> State where you ≈øhould be <hi>happy</hi> beyond all your Wi≈øhes, and to the <hi>utmo≈øt</hi> Capacity of your Nature; where you ≈øhould live with <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> in the mo≈øt <hi>rapturous</hi> Exerci≈øe of <hi>everla≈øting</hi> Love and Joy, which one would have thought had been <hi>≈øufficient</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence you for tho≈øe <hi>≈øilly</hi> Plea≈øures for who≈øe ≈øake you de≈øerted me and my Service.

                  <q>Why, is this the <hi>utmost</hi> that you can plead for <hi>your</hi> ≈øelves? Have I not told you all the≈øe things before-hand as plainly as Words could expre≈øs them? Have I not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtituted an Order of Men in my <hi>Church</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the≈øe things to you, and to put you in mind of them? So that whatever you pretend, you could not but know and under≈øtand them; or if you did not, it was becau≈øe you would not. And if you would wilfully ≈øhut your Eyes again≈øt the Light, it was <hi>your own</hi> Fault that you did not ≈øee, and you may thank <hi>your ≈øelves</hi> for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequents of it.

And ≈øeeing you would be ≈øo <hi>mad</hi> as to reject <hi>Heaven</hi> when it lay before you, and leap into <hi>Hell</hi> with your Eyes open, your Blood be upon <hi>your own</hi> Heads. For I have tried all the Arts of Love, and Methods of Kindne≈øs to reclaim you; and ≈øince you have render'd them all <hi>ineffectual,</hi> what remains but that you depart from me, like <hi>accur≈øed</hi> Wretches as you are, into that <hi>everla≈øting</hi> Fire prepared for the <hi>Devil</hi> and his <hi>Angels.</hi>

For thus, as I have ≈øhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you upon the <hi>Mount</hi> and in the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> it was a <hi>vi≈øible</hi> Demon≈øtration of the <hi>≈øpecial</hi> Pre≈øence of the <hi>invi≈øible</hi> God, and where≈øoever in all the <hi>Old Te≈øtament,</hi> any Mention is made of its Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:154348:134"/>you ≈øhall find that there <hi>God</hi> him≈øelf did peculiarly re≈øide: And therefore it is not to be imagined that <hi>God</hi> would have communicated to our <hi>Saviour,</hi> this <hi>in≈øeparable</hi> Token of his <hi>own</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence, unle≈øs the <hi>Divinity</hi> had re≈øided in him.

So that as this <hi>vi≈øible</hi> Glory was a <hi>certain</hi> Token of God's <hi>peculiar</hi> Re≈øidence in the Tabernacle and Temple, ≈øo it was al≈øo of his <hi>≈øpecial</hi> Pre≈øence in <hi>Chri≈øt;</hi> for the Hi≈øtory of his <hi>Bapti≈øm</hi> tells us, that it did not only make a <hi>tran≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> Appearance, but that it remained on him, ≈øig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying that the <hi>Divinity,</hi> who≈øe Pre≈øence was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted by it, had made him his Habitation and Place of <hi>con≈øtant</hi> Abode. For though that <hi>vi≈øible</hi> Glory after ≈øome Time di≈øappeared and went <hi>off</hi> from him, yet the Thing ≈øignified by it, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Divine Pre≈øence,</hi> always remained in him; for by that <hi>outward</hi> Glory he was clearly manife≈øted to be the <hi>Holy One of God,</hi> the Tabernacle and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary in which God was, and where he had taken up his Re≈øidence <hi>for ever,</hi> that his <hi>Humane</hi> Nature was that <hi>≈øacred</hi> TEmple where the <hi>Divinity</hi> intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to dwell, and from whence for the the <hi>future</hi> he would deliver all his Oracles, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate all his Ble≈ø≈øings to Mankind. So that in this Re≈øpect this <hi>vi≈øible</hi> Glory was ≈øuch as highly <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came</hi> the <hi>only begotten Son,</hi> becau≈øe it plainly

So that it was highly <hi>convenient</hi> that he ≈øhould become a Man, and being a Man it was indi≈øpen≈øably <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> that he ≈øhould live like a <hi>wi≈øe</hi> and a <hi>good</hi> Man in the Condition and Relations wherein he was placed, and nothing could be more <hi>worthy</hi> of or <hi>becoming</hi> him, then ≈øo to do, though he was ≈øtill the <hi>only begotten Son</hi> of the Father. For it is the Glory of <hi>God</hi> him≈øelf that he always acts mo≈øt rea≈øonably ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the State and Relations of a <hi>God;</hi> and therefore when <hi>God</hi> becomes Man by a≈ø≈øuming <hi>our</hi> Nature to his <hi>own,</hi> it is his Glory to act mo≈øt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonably in the State and Relations of a Man. And thus did the <hi>ble≈ø≈øed Je≈øus</hi> do in the whole Cour≈øe of his Conver≈øation upon Earth; for his Life was a mo≈øt <hi>exact</hi> Pattern of all <hi>humane</hi> Virtues, in which all that is <hi>ornamental</hi> to <hi>humane</hi> Nature was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øented in its <hi>faire≈øt</hi> Colours: There you may ≈øee a <hi>fair</hi> Example of the mo≈øt <hi>ardent</hi> Love to, and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtant</hi> Dependance upon <hi>God,</hi> of the mo≈øt <hi>profound</hi> Humility, and <hi>perfect</hi> Re≈øignation to his <hi>Heavenly</hi> Will.

                  <hi>Humane</hi> Pa≈ø≈øions and Appetites ≈øet forth to the Life, and fairly delineated in its mo≈øt <hi>exqui≈øite</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; in a word, there you will find <hi>Loyalty</hi> and <hi>Submi≈ø≈øion</hi> to <hi>Superiors, Fidelity</hi> and <hi>Ju≈øtice</hi> to <hi>Equals, Courte≈øy</hi> and <hi>Candor,</hi> and <hi>Conde≈øcention</hi> to <hi>Inferiors, univer≈øal</hi> Love, and an <hi>unbounded</hi> Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to all practi≈øed to the Height and Exactne≈øs; and which way ≈øoever you turn your Eyes on this <hi>fair</hi> Monument of Virtues, you can di≈øcover no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what is <hi>lovely</hi> and <hi>adorable,</hi> and infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becoming the <hi>only begotten Son of the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus explained and demon≈øtrated the Propo≈øition to you, I ≈øhall conclude with the≈øe four Inferences from this <hi>four-fold</hi> Glory of the <hi>Word</hi> which they ≈øaw.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They ≈øaw the <hi>glorious</hi> Splendor which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve≈øted his Per≈øon at his <hi>Bapti≈øon</hi> and <hi>Transfiguration:</hi> From whence I infer his Deputation from the mo≈øt <hi>High God,</hi> and Father of all Things, to be his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øentative and Vice-Roy in the <hi>Chri≈øtian Church.</hi> For this <hi>vi≈øible</hi> Glory with which he was inve≈øted, was always the <hi>peculiar</hi> Character of the <hi>immediate</hi> Repre≈øentative of <hi>God;</hi> and therefore by way of Appropriation it is called <hi>the Glory of God,</hi> and <hi>the Glory of the Lord;</hi> and where≈øover <hi>God,</hi> as <hi>Supream</hi> Monarch and Governor, is repre≈øented as re≈øiding and taking up his <hi>Royal</hi> Habitation, there you always find him di≈øplaying him≈øelf in this <hi>vi≈øible</hi> Glory and Splendor. Thus when by the <hi>Eternal Word</hi> he was repre≈øented among the <hi>Jews</hi> as their <hi>≈øupreme</hi> Lord and Governor, he always manife≈øted his <hi>Maje≈øtick</hi> Pre≈øence among them by ≈øome <hi>bright</hi> and <hi>≈øhining</hi> Appearance; the fir≈øt In≈øtance of which was his Appearance to <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> from out of
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:154348:138"/>the <hi>burning Bu≈øh</hi> upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> where he fir≈øt acted under <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> as <hi>Sovereign</hi> King of <hi>I≈ørael</hi> in commi≈ø≈øioning <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> to be their Captain and Leader out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> for here it is ≈øaid, that he <hi>appeared in a flame of fire, Exod.</hi> 3.2. that is, in a <hi>vi≈øible</hi> Glory that re≈øembled the Brightne≈øs of a Flame of Fire. For this Mountain he had cho≈øen for the Seat and Throne fo his <hi>Maje≈øtical</hi> Re≈øidence, from whence he intended to give Laws to <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> and to exert his <hi>Royal</hi> Dominion over them; and therefore here he appears in that <hi>vi≈øible</hi> Glory which was always the Character of the <hi>divine</hi> King, and <hi>immediate</hi> Repre≈øentative of <hi>God</hi> to that People. And indeed if that be true which <hi>Jo≈øephus</hi> tells us, this Mountain was looked upon as the Habitation of <hi>God</hi> long before ever <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> came thither; for therefore, ≈øays <hi>Jo≈øephus,</hi> did <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> drive his Father <hi>Jethro's</hi> Flock thither to feed, becau≈øe of all other Places it mo≈øt abounded with Pa≈øture,<note place="margin">Jo≈ø.

But whether that he <hi>true</hi> or <hi>fal≈øe,</hi> it's mo≈øt <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>apparent</hi> that where≈øoever he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:154348:139"/>as the King of <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> or Repre≈øentative of <hi>God</hi> to them, he always clothed him≈øelf in a <hi>vi≈øible</hi> Glory and Splendor. Thus he appeared to them in a Pillar of Fire, that is, in a mo≈øt <hi>bright</hi> and <hi>luminous</hi> Form, when he conducted them thro' the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> and the Wilderne≈øs; and when he came down upon Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> to give the Law to them, it's ≈øaid that the Glory in which they beheld him was <hi>like devouring fire, Exod.</hi> 24.17. that is, it was un≈øpeakably <hi>bright</hi> and <hi>refulgent,</hi> even like that of a mo≈øt <hi>inten≈øe</hi> and <hi>vehement</hi> Fire; and in all this <hi>radiant</hi> Glory did he di≈øplay him≈øelf from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Cherubims when he removed from the Mountain, and cho≈øe the Tabernacle for the Seat of his <hi>future</hi> Re≈øidence and <hi>Royal</hi> Abode. Thus where≈øoever he appeared in his <hi>Kingly</hi> Maje≈øty as the <hi>publick</hi> Repre≈øentative of his Father, this <hi>vi≈øible</hi> Glory is always made mention of, as that which was the <hi>peculiar</hi> Character of his Pre≈øence and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon. 'Tis true, 'tis recorded of <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> that when he came down from the Vi≈øion upon the Mount, his Face ≈øhone ≈øo brightly that the <hi>I≈øralites</hi> were not able to approach him; which ≈øeems to argue that this <hi>vi≈øible</hi> Glory was not ≈øo <hi>peculiar</hi> to the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Word</hi> as his Father's Repre≈øentative, as we would have it, ≈øince we plainly ≈øee it was <hi>common</hi> to <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> with him. But this doth no ways de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroy our A≈ø≈øertion; becau≈øe it's plain that <hi>that</hi> Glory which covered the Face of <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> was all derived from the Glory of the <hi>Eternal Word,</hi> with whom for <hi>forty</hi> Days he had conver≈øed in the Mount. For <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> being ≈øent down as an Apo≈øtle to the <hi>Jews</hi> to promulgate tho≈øe Laws to them which he had received upon the Mount, the <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:154348:139"/>Word,</hi> to convince the <hi>unbelieving Jews</hi> that he had ≈øent him, reflects upon his Face ≈øome Rays of Glory from that Sphere of Light in which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to and conver≈øed with him, that <hi>that</hi> might be an <hi>ocular</hi> Demon≈øtration to them that <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> came from him, and was commi≈ø≈øioned by him to preach and promulgate his Laws to them. So that <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> his Glory being derived from the <hi>Word,</hi> declared him to be his Apo≈øtle and Mini≈øter; even as the Glory of the <hi>Word</hi> being derived from the Father, declared him to be his Repre≈øentative and Vice-Roy; ≈øo that from its ≈øhining upon the Face of <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> it by no means follows that this <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible</hi> Glory is not the <hi>peculiar</hi> Character of God's <hi>immediate</hi> Repre≈øentative; becau≈øe that which ≈øhone upon his Face was only the <hi>Parhelius</hi> or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection of the <hi>vi≈øible</hi> Glory of him who was God's <hi>immediate</hi> Repre≈øentative. For ≈øo the Earth al≈øo is ≈øaid to <hi>≈øhine with the Glory of the God of I≈ørael, Ezek.</hi> 43.2. and as the Glory with which it ≈øhone was not the Glory of the Earth, but the Glory of the <hi>God of I≈ørael;</hi> ≈øo neither was that glory upon the Face of <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> the Glory of <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> but the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of that <hi>divine</hi> Per≈øon, with whom he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øed, derived to, and reflected upon him; and it being ≈øtill the <hi>proper</hi> Glory of that <hi>divine</hi> Per≈øon, may very well be ≈øaid to be the <hi>peculiar</hi> Character of his being the <hi>immediate</hi> Repre≈øentative of <hi>God,</hi> notwith≈øtanding it reflected from him upon <hi>Mo≈øes;</hi> e≈øpecially con≈øidering that this <hi>reflected</hi> Glory upon <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> his Face was to be an Evidence to the <hi>Jews</hi> that he came down to them as an Apo≈øtle from the <hi>Eternal Word</hi> with Authority to publi≈øh, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his Laws to them. For if this <hi>derivative</hi> Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:154348:140"/>was an Evidence that <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> came down as an Apo≈øtle from that <hi>divine</hi> Per≈øon on the Mount, then the <hi>original</hi> Splendor of that <hi>divine</hi> Per≈øon whence it was derived and reflected, was at lea≈øt an <hi>equal</hi> Evidence that he came down upon the Mount as the Apo≈øtle, and <hi>immediate</hi> Repre≈øenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the mo≈øt <hi>High God</hi> him≈øelf.</p>
               <p>And in the ≈øame manner we find that the <hi>Word INcarnate</hi> did give Evidence to the Commi≈ø≈øion of his <hi>Chri≈øtian Apo≈øtles;</hi> for upon the <hi>Day of Penteco≈øt,</hi> when they were a≈ø≈øembled together, it is ≈øaid that <hi>there appeared unto them cloven Tongues like as of fire, and ≈øat upon every one of them, Acts</hi> 2.3. that is, there were ≈øeveral Fla≈øhes or Beams of Glory which like <hi>bright</hi> Flames of Fire, did cleave a≈øunder in many Places according to the <hi>natural</hi> Motion of Flames, of which every Part as it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it ≈øelf in Length grows more <hi>Spire-like</hi> or <hi>Pyramidal,</hi> and ≈øo divides from the part next to it; and upon the Head of every one of the Apo≈øtles, did one of the≈øe <hi>divided</hi> Flames of Glory re≈øt in the Form of a Tongue, which like a Flame grows <hi>≈øharper</hi> and <hi>≈øharper</hi> towards the Top: For thus the <hi>Hebrew Idiom</hi> for a Flame of Fire u≈øes the <hi>Tongue</hi> of Fire, becau≈øe o fthe Re≈øemblance that is between them, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 5.24. So that as the <hi>Eternal Word</hi> did evidence to the <hi>Jews</hi> the Apo≈øtle≈øhip of <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> by that <hi>vi≈øible</hi> Glory which he reflected on his Face, ≈øo did the <hi>Word Incarnate</hi> evidence to the <hi>Chri≈øtian Church</hi> the Apo≈øtle≈øhip of the <hi>Twelve</hi> by this <hi>vi≈øible</hi> Glory which he derived upon them. For now, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Bapti≈øt's</hi> Prediction of him, he baptized them <hi>with the Holy Gho≈øt, and with Fire, Luke</hi> 3.16. that is, by the <hi>outward</hi> Sign of that <hi>vi≈øible</hi>
                  <pb n="285" facs="tcp:154348:140"/>Glory which re≈øted like Fire upon them, he ≈øolemnly initiated them into their <hi>Apo≈øtle≈øhip,</hi> and declared them to be the <hi>Heralds</hi> of his Will to the World. And as this <hi>vi≈øible</hi> Glory with which he baptized them, was an Evidence of their being ≈øent <hi>from,</hi> and commi≈ø≈øionated by <hi>him</hi> to bear his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and repre≈øent his Per≈øon; ≈øo that <hi>vi≈øible</hi> Glory with which he was baptized from <hi>Heaven,</hi> fir≈øt in the River <hi>Jordan,</hi> and afterwards upon Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> was an <hi>undoubted</hi> Evidence that he was ≈øent from <hi>above</hi> to be his Father's Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øentative in the <hi>Church:</hi> For if thier ≈øhining wiht his Glory was an Evidence of their being inve≈øted with his Authority, then his ≈øhining with his Father's Glory mu≈øt be an <hi>equal</hi> Evidence of his being inve≈øted with the Authority of his Father. And as this <hi>vi≈øible</hi> Glory was always the <hi>peculiar</hi> Character of God's <hi>immediate</hi> Repre≈øentative, and the <hi>Royal</hi> Crown and Robes as it were with which the mo≈øt <hi>High</hi> adorned him at his <hi>Inauguration,</hi> and Inve≈øtment with his <hi>own Kingly</hi> Authority; ≈øo St. <hi>Peter</hi> expre≈øly tells <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his Company, that <hi>God had anointed him with the Holy Gho≈øt, and with Power, Acts</hi> 10.13. that is, by that <hi>outward</hi> Sign of the <hi>vi≈øible</hi> Glory in which the <hi>Holy Gho≈øt</hi> de≈øcended upon him, he had inve≈øted him with <hi>Regal</hi> Power, and deputed and declared him to be King of the <hi>Church.</hi> And this in all probability was the Rea≈øon why he forbad his Di≈øciples to declare his Tran≈øfiguration till after <hi>his Re≈øurrection from the Dead, Mark</hi> 9.9. becau≈øe he knew that if they did, the <hi>Jews</hi> would not believe it, but would maliciou≈øly interpret it to be a <hi>fal≈øe</hi> Pretence of his to the Title of God's <hi>immediate</hi> Repre≈øenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:154348:141"/>and Vice-Roy, that <hi>vi≈øible</hi> Glory in which he appeared being the <hi>proper</hi> Character of that <hi>divine</hi> King by whom the mo≈øt <hi>High God</hi> had formerly governed them; and therefore in all the Hi≈øtory of his Life you find he did indu≈øtriou≈øly avoid openly to avow his <hi>Regal</hi> Authority, and only in≈øinuates it by Con≈øequences and <hi>ob≈øeure</hi> Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For ≈øo violently were they prejudiced again≈øt his being their <hi>King</hi> upon the account of his <hi>ob≈øcure</hi> Parentage, and <hi>mean</hi> Condition, that he could not but fore≈øee how <hi>un≈øea≈øonable</hi> it would yet be publickly to own his <hi>Regal</hi> Authority, and con≈øequently the Glory of his Transfiguration which did ≈øo apparently infer it; till by more <hi>miraculous</hi> Effects, and particularly by his <hi>Re≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the Dead,</hi> he had ≈øufficiently proved and demon≈øtrated it; and then he openly declares without any Re≈øerve, that <hi>all power was given him in Heaven and Earth, Matth.</hi> 28.18. Since therefore it is ≈øo apparent by this <hi>Characteri≈øtical</hi> Glory, in which his Per≈øon was inrobed, and which the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtle</hi> a≈ø≈øures us they ≈øaw him inve≈øted with, we have all the Rea≈øon in the World to conclude that the mo≈øt <hi>High God</hi> hath deputed him to be King and Lord of the <hi>Church.</hi> For when the <hi>Apo≈øtle</hi> tells us that they ≈øaw this <hi>vi≈øible</hi> Glory which ≈øhone upon him at his <hi>Bapti≈øm</hi> and <hi>Transfiguration,</hi> he doth as good as ≈øay that they ≈øaw all the Solemnity of his <hi>divine</hi> Coronation, that they beheld the mo≈øt <hi>High God</hi> circling his Brows with the <hi>Royal</hi> Diadem, and inve≈øting his <hi>≈øacred</hi> Body with the <hi>Imperial</hi> Robes of the <hi>great</hi> King of the World. So that if it be true what St. <hi>John</hi> ≈øays, that they did ≈øee this Glory, (as we have all the Rea≈øon in
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:154348:141"/>the World to conclude it is, becau≈øe he offered to ≈øeal his Te≈øtimony of it with his Blood, and the other <hi>two</hi> that ≈øaw it with him actually did ≈øo) then we cannot but acknowledge the <hi>ble≈ø≈øed Je≈øus</hi> to be <hi>our</hi> King, to who≈øe <hi>divine</hi> Authority we are bound to pay the <hi>lowe≈øt</hi> Homage and Obedience; and that when≈øoever we wilfully tran≈øgre≈øs his Laws, we do openly rebel again≈øt our mo≈øt <hi>rightful</hi> Sovereign, to who≈øe Service we are bound by all <hi>po≈ø≈øible</hi> Ties and Obligations.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They ≈øaw the Glory of that <hi>miraculous</hi> Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which he exerted in the Cour≈øe of his Mini≈øtry; from whence I infer the Credibility of the <hi>Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion:</hi> For the many <hi>≈øtupendous</hi> Miracles that he wrought, were a mo≈øt <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>unque≈øtionable</hi> Evidence of a <hi>Divine</hi> Power re≈øiding in him, and accompanying his Mini≈øtry. For never were there ≈øo many <hi>miraculous</hi> Effects produced, either <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> or <hi>≈øince,</hi> in the World, by the mo≈øt <hi>renowned</hi> Workers of Miracles that ever were; and all that hath been done by the mo≈øt <hi>famous</hi> Magicians, that are recorded in Hi≈øtory, were but like the <hi>little</hi> Tricks and Delu≈øions of <hi>Jugglers,</hi> compared with the <hi>wondrous</hi> Works of our <hi>Saviour;</hi> and yet 'tis apparent that his Education had been mo≈øt <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>≈øimple,</hi> that he never had been in≈øtructed in any <hi>Mathematical</hi> Science, or <hi>my≈øtical</hi> Rites, or in any <hi>other</hi> Art of performing Wonders, either by <hi>Humane</hi> Wit or <hi>Diabolical</hi> A≈ø≈øi≈øtance; but was bred up under the Care of his <hi>poor hone≈øt</hi> Parents, who were forced to earn their Bread with the Sweat of their Brows, and ≈øo in all Probability was trained up in his Father's Profe≈ø≈øion, that ≈øo by his <hi>daily</hi> Labour he might be able to contribute
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:154348:142"/>to the Charge of his Maintenance. And yet 'tis plain, this <hi>home-bred</hi> Per≈øon ≈øometimes, only by ≈øpeaking of a Word, ≈øometimes meerly by the Touch of his Hand, ≈øometimes by a <hi>≈øilent</hi> Virtue proceeding from him without any <hi>outward</hi> Sign intervening, did <hi>more</hi> and far <hi>greater</hi> Wonders in <hi>three</hi> or <hi>four</hi> Years Time, then all the mo≈øt <hi>skilful Phy≈øicians, Magicians</hi> and <hi>Mathematicians</hi> could ever do either <hi>before</hi> or <hi>after</hi> him. Now how was it po≈ø≈øible that ever ≈øuch a Per≈øon ≈øhould ever have accompli≈øhed ≈øuch <hi>great</hi> and <hi>mighty</hi> Things as he did, had he not been indued with Power from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove?

For it is not <hi>≈øuppo≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> that the <hi>God</hi> of Truth would have endued our <hi>Saviour</hi> with this <hi>miraculous</hi> Power, had that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine been <hi>fal≈øe</hi> which he ≈øought to confirm by it; becau≈øe in ≈øo doing he would have openly <hi>patroniz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> a Cheat, and de≈øignedly contributed to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of an Impo≈øture, which is utterly <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtent</hi> with his Truth and Veracity: So that now the Truth of <hi>Chri≈øtianity</hi> finally re≈øolves into the Veracity of <hi>God,</hi> which is the Foundation of all the Certainty in the World.

So that the <hi>heavenly Things</hi> contained in the <hi>Go≈øpel</hi> were the <hi>≈øub≈øtantial</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea's which tho≈øe <hi>Legal</hi> Types and Patterns con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and repre≈øented; and the ≈øame Author calls that Law <hi>a ≈øhadow of good things to come, Heb.</hi> 10.1. that is, it was an <hi>ob≈øcure</hi> Scheme or Prefigurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Mercies of the <hi>Go≈øpel,</hi> of which <hi>eternal</hi> Life is a <hi>principal</hi> Part. Since therefore the Law was nothing el≈øe but only the <hi>Go≈øpel</hi> in <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcure</hi> Cyphers, if in <hi>this</hi> we <hi>Chri≈øtians</hi> have <hi>eternal Life,</hi> in <hi>that</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> had it al≈øo: And therefore the Rea≈øon which our <hi>Saviour</hi> here urges to oblige the <hi>Jews</hi> to <hi>≈øearch the Scriptures</hi> of the <hi>Old Te≈øtament; [for in them ye think have eternal life]</hi> doth at lea≈øt equally oblige us <hi>Chri≈øtians</hi> to ≈øearch the Scriptures both of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New.</hi> For if they had <hi>ju≈øt</hi> Rea≈øon to think they had <hi>eternal Life</hi> in the <hi>Old Te≈øtament,</hi> and were thereupon obliged to ≈øearch into it, we have rather <hi>more</hi> Rea≈øon to think that we have <hi>eternal Life</hi> in the <hi>New,</hi> ≈øince the <hi>New

In the Pro≈øecution of this Argument therefore, I ≈øhall endeavour the≈øe <hi>Two</hi> Things.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> infpired the Writers of the <hi>Scripture</hi> with all that is <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> to <hi>eternal Life.</hi> For <hi>fir≈øt,</hi> our <hi>Saviour,</hi> by whom they were origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in≈øtructed, declares, that as the <hi>Father loved him, and ≈øhewed him all things that him≈øelf did, Joh.</hi> 5.20. ≈øo <hi>he had made known to them all things that he had heard of his Father, Job.</hi> 17.8. And then when he went from them, and cea≈øed to in≈øtruct them in his <hi>own</hi> Per≈øon, he promi≈øed that by his <hi>Spirit</hi> he would <hi>teach them all things, and bring all things to their remembrance what≈øoever he had ≈øaid unto them, Job.</hi> 14.26. and that by the ≈øame <hi>Spirit</hi> he would <hi>guide them into all Truth, Job.</hi> 16.13. If therefore the <hi>Spirit</hi> did perform this Promi≈øe to them, (as there is no doubt but he did) then we are ≈øure that he did teach them over again what≈øoever <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> had taught them before, and if <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> had taught them what≈øoever he had heard of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (as he declares he had) then it is certain either that he taught them all Things <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> to <hi>eternal Life,</hi> or that he him≈øelf had not heard from
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:154348:149"/>his Father all Things that are nece≈ø≈øary thereunto.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That as they were taught by the Spirit, all Things <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> to <hi>eternal Life,</hi> ≈øo what they were taught, they preached and delivered to the World. For ≈øo our <hi>Saviour</hi> commanded them to go forth into all the World, and <hi>teach all Nations to ob≈øerve all</hi> tho≈øe <hi>things which he had commanded</hi> them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20. Which Injunction of his they ≈øtrictly ob≈øerved; for ≈øo we are told, that in Obedience to it, <hi>they went forth, and preached every where, Mark,</hi> 16.20. And that their preaching extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all Things <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> to Salvation, is evident from their <hi>own</hi> Te≈øtimony: For thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Ephe≈øians</hi> that he had <hi>not ≈øhunned to declare unto them the whole Coun≈øel of God, Acts</hi> 20.27. And to be ≈øure in the <hi>whole</hi> Coun≈øel of <hi>God,</hi> all that is <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> to Salvation mu≈øt be included.

And this very <hi>Go≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi> which the Apo≈øtles in their <hi>con≈øtant</hi> Mini≈øtry propo≈øed to the World, St. <hi>James</hi> calls the <hi>ingraft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Word, which is able to ≈øave our Souls, Jam.</hi> 1.21.

And <hi>the Savour of Life unto Life,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16. And al≈øo <hi>the Power of God unto Salvation to every one that believes, Rom.</hi> 1.17.

               <p n="3">3. And la≈øtly, That all tho≈øe <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> Truths which they preached, are comprehended in tho≈øe Writings of theirs, of which the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> con≈øi≈øts. It is true, before the <hi>Chri≈øtian</hi> Doctrine was collected into tho≈øe <hi>Scriptures</hi> of which the <hi>New Te≈øtament</hi> now con≈øi≈øts, it was all conveyed by <hi>Oral Tradition</hi> from the Mouths of the Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to the Ears of the Di≈øciples; but in a <hi>little</hi> Time tho≈øe <hi>holy</hi> Men who fir≈øt preached it, found an <hi>ab≈øolute</hi> Nece≈ø≈øity of committing it to Writing, as a much <hi>≈øurer</hi> Way of pre≈øerving it <hi>uncorrupted,</hi> and tran≈ømitting it down to all <hi>≈øucceeding</hi> Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for thus <hi>Eu≈øebius</hi> tells us,<note n="1" place="margin">Hi≈øt.

After which he tells us,<note n="2" place="margin">L. 3 c. 24.</note> that <hi>St.</hi> Mathew <hi>and St.</hi> John <hi>were the only Di≈øciples of our Lord, who had left written Commentaries of the Things which they

For</hi> Matthew <hi>hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preached the Faith to the Hebrews, and intending to go from them to other Nations, wrote his Go≈øpel in his own Country-Language, that thereby he might ≈øupply the Want of his Pre≈øence to tho≈øe whom he left behind him. And afterwards when</hi> Mark <hi>and</hi> Luke <hi>had pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øhed their Go≈øpels,</hi> John <hi>who had hitherto only preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Go≈øpel by Word of Mouth, being at length moved by the ≈øame Rea≈øon betook him≈øelf to write. And the Three former Go≈øpels,</hi> ≈øays he, <hi>arriving to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all Men, and particularly of St.</hi> John, <hi>he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved them, and with his own Te≈øtimony confirmed the Truth of them.</hi> From which Relation it's evident, that <hi>that</hi> which moved tho≈øe <hi>holy</hi> Men to commit their <hi>Go≈øpels</hi> to Writing, was this, that they judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> for the Con≈øervation of the <hi>Chri≈øtian</hi> Doctrine, that ≈øo the≈øe in their Ab≈øence might be <hi>≈øtanding</hi> Monuments of the Faith, to preach that <hi>Go≈øpel</hi> to Mens Eyes which they had preached to their Ears: And if they wrote to pre≈øerve the Faith, to be ≈øure they would leave no <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> or <hi>e≈ø≈øential</hi> Part of it unwritten. There are ≈øeveral Propo≈øitions in the≈øe <hi>Go≈øpels</hi> which, though very <hi>u≈øeful,</hi> are far from being <hi>e≈ø≈øential</hi> Parts of <hi>Chri≈øtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;</hi> and can we imagine that tho≈øe <hi>holy</hi> Men who wrote on purpo≈øe to con≈øerve <hi>Christianity,</hi> ≈øhould take ≈øo much Care to write many Things which are not <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> Parts, and in the mean time omit any Things that are? <hi>Eu≈øebius</hi> tells us of St <hi>Mark</hi> in particular, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                  </gap>; i. e. <hi>he took great Care of this more e≈øpecially, not to pretermit any of tho≈øe Things which he had heard,</hi> (even from St.
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:154348:150"/>
                  <hi>Peter</hi>) <hi>nor to affix any thing to them that was fal≈øe:</hi> And if he were ≈øo <hi>careful</hi> not to omit any Thing, to be ≈øure he would be particularly careful not to omit any thing which he judged <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> to the <hi>eternal</hi> Happine≈øs of Men. But what need we depend upon <hi>humane</hi> Authority, when as, if we con≈øult tho≈øe <hi>Sacred</hi> Writings them≈øelves, (which ≈øo far as they go, all <hi>Chri≈øtians</hi> allow to be the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God</hi>) we ≈øhall find they give this Te≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of them≈øelves, that they comprehend in them all Things <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> to <hi>eternal</hi> Life. For thus the Writers of the <hi>New Te≈øtament</hi> te≈øtify of the <hi>Old, That they are able to make us wi≈øe unto Salvation through Faith which is in Je≈øus Chri≈øt,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. And if the <hi>Old Te≈øtament</hi> alone was able to do this, then much more the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New</hi> together; but how could they make Men <hi>wi≈øe to Salvation,</hi> if they were <hi>defective</hi> in any Article that is <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? and then the ≈øame Author goes on and tells us, that <hi>all Scripture is given by In≈øpiration of God, and is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, for In≈øtruction in Righteou≈øne≈øs; that the Man of God may be perfect, throughly furni≈øhed unto all good works, v.</hi> 16, 17. And if the <hi>Old Scriptures</hi> were <hi>≈øufficient</hi> to make the Man of God <hi>perfect,</hi> and to furni≈øh him throughly unto all <hi>good</hi> Works, one would think that the <hi>New</hi> and <hi>Old</hi> together ≈øhould not be <hi>defective.</hi> For that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> of the <hi>New Te≈øtament</hi> as well as of the <hi>Old</hi> contain in them all Things <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> to <hi>eternal Life,</hi> they them≈øelves do plainly te≈øtify of them≈øelves: For thus St. <hi>Luke</hi> in the Beginning of his <hi>Go≈øpel</hi> tells his <hi>Theophilus,</hi> to whom he writes, that <hi>fora≈ømuch as many had ≈øet forth a Declaration of
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:154348:151"/>tho≈øe things that were ≈øurely believed among Chri≈øtians, it ≈øeemed good unto him al≈øo having had a perfect under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding of all things from the first, to write them down in order that he might know the Certainty of tho≈øe things wherein he had been instructed:</hi> From whence I infer, that ≈øuppo≈øing St. <hi>Luke</hi> performed what he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øed, his <hi>Go≈øpel</hi> mu≈øt contain a <hi>full</hi> Declaration of the <hi>Chri≈øtian Religion:</hi> For, <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> by promi≈øing to give an Account of tho≈øe Things which were ≈øurely believed among <hi>Christians,</hi> he engaged him≈øelf to give an <hi>entire</hi> Account of <hi>Christianity,</hi> unle≈øs we will ≈øuppo≈øe that there were ≈øome Parts of <hi>Chri≈øtianity</hi> which the <hi>Chri≈øtians</hi> of that Time did not ≈øurely believe. <hi>Secondly,</hi> In promi≈øing to give an Account of tho≈øe Things of which he had a <hi>perfect</hi> Under≈øtanding from the fir≈øt, and in which his <hi>Theophilus</hi> had been in≈øtructed, he al≈øo engages him≈øelf to give a <hi>compleat</hi> Account of the whole <hi>Religion,</hi> unle≈øs we will ≈øuppo≈øe that there were ≈øome Parts of this <hi>Religion</hi> which St. <hi>Luke</hi> did not perfectly under≈øtand, and in which <hi>Theophilus</hi> had not been before in≈øtructed. Thus al≈øo St. <hi>John</hi> te≈øtifies of his <hi>Go≈øpel,</hi> Chap. 20. 31. <hi>The≈øe things are written, that ye might believe that Je≈øus is the Chri≈øt the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life through his name.</hi> And if it be objected that by <hi>the≈øe Things</hi> the Apo≈øtle only means the Miracles of <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> which are the Motives of our Belief, and not his Doctrines which are to be believed by us; this is notoriou≈øly <hi>fal≈øe,</hi> ≈øince by <hi>the≈øe Things</hi> St. <hi>John</hi> means his <hi>Go≈øpel</hi> in which not only the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, but the Doctrines of <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> are contained; and therefore in his fir≈øt Epi≈øtle, <hi>chap.</hi> 5. 13. he ≈øaith, <hi>The≈øe things have I written unto you that believe
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:154348:151"/>on the name of the Son of God that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe,</hi> or continue to believe <hi>on the name of the Son of God;</hi> Where by <hi>The≈øe Things</hi> it's plain he means only that <hi>Chri≈øtian</hi> Doctrine which he had been teaching throughout the whole Epi≈øtle. From which <hi>two</hi> Places I argue, that <hi>all</hi> Things <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> to <hi>eternal Life</hi> are written, becau≈øe he expre≈øly tells us that <hi>The≈øe Things</hi> were written to this end, that they might beget and nouri≈øh in us that Faith by which we may obtain <hi>eternal Life;</hi> but if that Faith which the≈øe <hi>written</hi> Things was de≈øigned to beget in us, be not <hi>≈øufficient</hi> to <hi>eternal Life,</hi> then were the≈øe Things written in vain, and the End of writing them, which was that we might obtain <hi>eternal Life,</hi> by believing them, was wholly fru≈øtrated; but if that Faith were <hi>≈øufficient</hi> to <hi>eternal Life,</hi> then the≈øe <hi>written</hi> Things which begot that Faith, and were the Object of it, mu≈øt contain in them all Things <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> to <hi>eternal Life;</hi> for how can they beget in us a Faith that is <hi>≈øufficient</hi> to <hi>eternal Life,</hi> unle≈øs they propo≈øe to our Faith all Things that are <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary</hi> thereunto?</p>
               <p>And thus I have endeavoured to demon≈øtrate from <hi>Scripture</hi> it ≈øelf, which all agree is the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and con≈øequently the mo≈øt <hi>concluding</hi> Authority in the World, that the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> is in it ≈øelf a <hi>≈øufficient</hi> Rule of Faith and Manners to direct Men to <hi>eternal Life.</hi> And if this be ≈øo, I would fain know by what Warrant or Authority any Man or <hi>Church,</hi> can pretend to obtrude upon the Faith of <hi>Chri≈øtians</hi> any <hi>unwritten Traditions,</hi> or Doctrines of Faith, and Rules of Wor≈øhip, not <hi>recorded</hi> in <hi>Scripture</hi> as of <hi>equal</hi> Authority with tho≈øe <hi>recorded</hi>
                  <pb n="308" facs="tcp:154348:152"/>in <hi>Scripture,</hi> and equally <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> to the <hi>eternal</hi> Happine≈øs of Men. For that there have been ≈øuch <hi>bold</hi> Impo≈øers in the <hi>Christian</hi> World <hi>Irenaeus</hi> a≈ø≈øures us in the 2d Chapter of his 2d Book again≈øt <hi>Here≈øies;</hi> where he tells us of a ≈øort of <hi>Hereticks</hi> who taught, that <hi>the Truth could not be found in the Scriptures by tho≈øe to whom Tradition was unknown; for as much as it was not delivered by Writing, but by Word of Mouth.</hi> And the≈øe Hereticks<note n="1" place="margin">De Prae≈øcrip.

But then that forecited
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:154348:157"/>Pa≈ø≈øage of <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> doth in <hi>expre≈øs</hi> Words contradict this Cavil of <hi>Bellarmin;</hi> for he tells the People that <hi>the Commandment he gave them was not hidden from them;</hi> whereas if it had been ≈øo ob≈øcurely delivered to them by <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> that upon their <hi>≈øincere</hi> and <hi>diligent</hi> Enquiry they could not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand it, it is certain that it had been ≈øtill hidden from them how <hi>wi≈øe</hi> ≈øoever it might make them when they did under≈øtand it: And to ≈øay that ≈øuch a Propo≈øition will make me <hi>wi≈øe</hi> when I do under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand it, is no Argument at all that it is not hidden from me if it be ≈øo ob≈øcurely expre≈ø≈øed, as that upon my <hi>≈øincere</hi> Enquiry I am not capable of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding it. But that the <hi>Old Te≈øtament</hi> at lea≈øt in all <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> Matters was <hi>plain</hi> enough even to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> Capacities, is evident from the <hi>frequent</hi> Appeals our <hi>Saviour</hi> makes to it in his Conte≈øts with the <hi>Common People</hi> of the <hi>Jews.</hi> Thus in the Text he bids them, <hi>Search the Scriptures, for they are they which te≈øtify of me;</hi> and in <hi>other</hi> Places <hi>What ≈øaith the Scripture?</hi> and <hi>doth not the Scripture</hi> ≈øay ≈øo and ≈øo? Now how <hi>impertinent</hi> would it have been for our <hi>Saviour</hi> thus to appeal to it at the Tribunal of the People, if he thought it ≈øo <hi>ob≈øcure</hi> that the People were not <hi>capable</hi> of under≈øtanding it? How <hi>trifling</hi> would it be for a Man to appeal to <hi>Suarez's Metaphy≈øicks</hi> in a Controver≈øy with a <hi>Plow-man,</hi> or to refer him to <hi>Euclid's Elements</hi> for the determining the Bounds and Mea≈øures of a Field?</p>
               <p>And as from what hath been ≈øaid, 'tis apparent that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> of the <hi>Old Te≈øtament</hi> were at lea≈øt in all Nece≈ø≈øaries <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>clear</hi> to the <hi>Jews;</hi> ≈øo it is no <hi>le≈øs</hi> evident that the <hi>Scripture</hi> of the <hi>New
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:154348:158"/>Te≈øtament</hi> are ≈øo to <hi>Chri≈øtians,</hi> ≈øince it gives the ≈øame Te≈øtimony to it ≈øelf of its <hi>own</hi> Clearne≈øs, as the <hi>Old Testament</hi> doth. For thus, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.2, 3, 4. the Apo≈øtle tells us, that they did not <hi>handle the Word of God deceitfully, but by manifestation of the Truth, commending them≈øelves to Mens Con≈øciences in the ≈øight of God. But if our Go≈øpel be hid, it is hid to them that are lo≈øt; in whom the God of this World hath blinded the Minds of them which believe not, le≈øt the light of the glorious Go≈øpel of Chri≈øt, who is the Image of God, ≈øhould ≈øhine unto them.</hi> Suppo≈øing then that they wrote with the ≈øame Plainne≈øs and Clearne≈øs with which they ≈øpeak, (which there is no ≈øhadow of Rea≈øon to doubt of) then from the≈øe Words it is evident; <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> That they did neither in their Preaching nor Writings affect to di≈øcour≈øe dubiou≈øly or ob≈øcurely, but that their <hi>great</hi> De≈øign was ≈øo to manife≈øt and make known the Truth as that by their Plainne≈øs and Simplicity they might recommend them≈øelves to the Con≈øciences of all that heard or read them: <hi>Secondly,</hi> That in Fact they had in their Sermons and Writings ≈øo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taught the <hi>Go≈øpel,</hi> that if after all it remained <hi>hidden</hi> or <hi>ob≈øcure</hi> to any, it was only to ≈øuch as were <hi>lo≈øt</hi> and <hi>irrecoverable. Thirdly,</hi> That <hi>that</hi> which render'd the <hi>Go≈øpel</hi> which they had taught and written, <hi>hidden</hi> or <hi>ob≈øcure</hi> to ≈øuch, was not the Ob≈øcurity either of the Matter which they taught, or of their Manner of Teaching it, but their own <hi>worldly</hi> Affections which blinded their Eyes, and hindred them from ≈øeeing that which in its ≈øelf was illu≈øtriou≈øly <hi>vi≈øible.</hi> Which is an <hi>unan≈øwerable</hi> Evidence of the Clearne≈øs and Plainne≈øs of the Scriptures of the <hi>New Te≈øtament</hi> in all <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi>
                  <pb n="321" facs="tcp:154348:158"/>Things; for if they are <hi>clear</hi> to all but ≈øuch as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ≈øhut their Eyes again≈øt them, they are as <hi>clear</hi> as they need be to <hi>hone≈øt</hi> and <hi>teachable</hi> Minds; for there is nothing can be clear enough to ≈øuch, as are not willing to under≈øtand. And accordingly the <hi>Go≈øpel,</hi> which the Apo≈øtle calls <hi>the Grace of God which bringeth Salvation,</hi> is ≈øaid to have <hi>appeared,</hi> or ≈øhone forth, <hi>to all Men; teaching us, that deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>ngodline≈øs and worldly Lu≈øts, we ≈øhould live ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, righteou≈øly, and godly in this pre≈øent World, Tit.</hi> 2.11. Now if the <hi>Go≈øpel</hi> did ≈øhine forth unto all Men, it mu≈øt be in the <hi>Sermons</hi> and <hi>Di≈øcour≈øes</hi> of tho≈øe that had preached it to the World; and if they <hi>≈øo</hi> preached it as that it ≈øhone forth to all Men, they mu≈øt nece≈ø≈øarily have preached it very plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and clearly: Either therefore it was wrote as it was preached, or it was not; if it was not, it was not wrote truly and ≈øincerely; if it was, it was wrote very plainly, ≈øo as to make it appear and ≈øhine forth to all that read it. 'Tis true, there are ≈øome Things <hi>ob≈øcure</hi> both in the <hi>Old Scriptures</hi> and <hi>New;</hi> but then the≈øe are ≈øuch Things as are no Parts of the <hi>Nece≈ø≈øaries</hi> and <hi>E≈ø≈øentials</hi> of <hi>Religion;</hi> ≈øuch Things as Men may be ≈øafely <hi>ignorant</hi> of, or be <hi>mi≈øtaken</hi> about, without any hazard of their <hi>eternal</hi> Life. For all that the <hi>fore-cited</hi> Te≈øtimonies prove is only this, that <hi>that true Religion</hi> by which <hi>God</hi> governs the Faith and Manners of Men, is ≈øo far forth as it is <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> to be believed and practi≈øed, plainly and clearly revealed to them in the <hi>Holy Scriptures.</hi> But be≈øides this, all Men agree there are a <hi>great</hi> many <hi>other</hi> Things revealed in <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> which, becau≈øe they are not <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> for all Men to under≈øtand, are many of them not ≈øo
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:154348:159"/>plainly revealed as that all Men may under≈øtand them. But ≈øince the <hi>Scripture</hi> was written to teach and in≈øtruct Men, to be ≈øure it teaches them mo≈øt plainly that which is mo≈øt <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> for them to know; and therefore ≈øince there are ≈øome Things plainly taught in <hi>Scripture,</hi> as is evident to any one that reads it, to be ≈øure among the≈øe Things are contained all that is <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> for Men to know and under≈øtand.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From the <hi>avowed</hi> De≈øign of writing the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> it is al≈øo evident, that in all Things <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> it is <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>clear.</hi> For thus concerning the <hi>Old Te≈øtament,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us that <hi>what≈øoever things were written afore time, were written for our learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope, Rom.</hi> 15.4. And if they were written for our Learning and In≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to be ≈øure they were ≈øo written as to teach and in≈øtruct us, that is, plainly and clearly, e≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as to tho≈øe Things wherein we have mo≈øt need to be in≈øtructed. And then as for the <hi>New Te≈øtament,</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> tells his <hi>Theophilus,</hi> that the Rea≈øon of his writing his <hi>Go≈øpel</hi> was that he might know the certainty of tho≈øe things that were ≈øurely believed among <hi>Chri≈øtians,</hi> and wherein he him≈øelf had been in≈øtructed; And if it were to a≈øcertain us of the Principles of <hi>Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi> that he wrote his <hi>Go≈øpel,</hi> certainly he would take care to write it after ≈øuch a Manner as that tho≈øe that read it might under≈øtand it, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe he mu≈øt run counter to his <hi>own</hi> De≈øign. Thus al≈øo St. <hi>John</hi> ≈øaith, that he wrote his <hi>Go≈øpel</hi> that Men might <hi>believe that Je≈øus is the Chri≈øt the Son of God;</hi> but how could his <hi>Go≈øpel</hi> induce Men
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:154348:159"/>to believe This, unle≈øs it be ≈øo <hi>written</hi> as that Men may under≈øtand it? And ≈øo al≈øo for his Epi≈øtles he tells us, that he wrote them that <hi>they that believed in Je≈øus might know that they have eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, and that they may believe,</hi> or continue to believe, <hi>on the name of the Son of God:</hi> And if this were his End, to be ≈øure he would take care to write ≈øo as that they might under≈øtand; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe how could they know by his Writing that they had <hi>eternal Life,</hi> or be moved thereby to continue to believe on the name of Je≈øus? For there is nothing can create in Men either Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or Faith, but what they under≈øtand. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore the <hi>great</hi> End of Writing the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> was to in≈øtruct the World in the <hi>great</hi> Things of <hi>Religion,</hi> either we mu≈øt ≈øay that both the Writers of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Gho≈øt</hi> that in≈øpired them were <hi>defective</hi> in Skill, or in Care ≈øo to write as to obtain this End; or that their Writings are an <hi>effectual</hi> Means to obtain it, which it is <hi>impo≈ø≈øible</hi> for them to be, unle≈øs they are <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>clear</hi> as to the <hi>great</hi> Things of <hi>Religion.</hi> In ≈øhort every <hi>wi≈øe</hi> Agent pur≈øues his End by the mo≈øt <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>effectual</hi> Means; and I would fain know whether to write plainly or ob≈øcurely be the mo≈øt <hi>proper</hi> Means to in≈øtruct Men by Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; if to write plainly, then either the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtles</hi> wrote ≈øo, or they were not <hi>wi≈øe</hi> Agents, ≈øince to in≈øtruct was the <hi>great</hi> End of their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. The mo≈øt <hi>natural</hi> Way of conveying to Mens Minds the Notices of Things is by Words either <hi>≈øpoken</hi> or <hi>written,</hi> and ≈øeeing what≈øoever can be <hi>≈øpoken</hi> in plain and <hi>intelligible</hi> Words may be <hi>written</hi> in the ≈øame Words, there can be no
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:154348:160"/>doubt but tho≈øe Words will be as <hi>intelligible</hi> when they are <hi>written,</hi> as when they are <hi>≈øpoken;</hi> for why ≈øhould the ≈øame Words be more <hi>ob≈øcure</hi> when conveyed to us by our Eyes, than when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to us by our Ears? Seeing then the Sen≈øe of <hi>Scripture</hi> may be as plainly conveyed by Words <hi>written</hi> as by Words <hi>≈øpoken,</hi> and ≈øeeing that even tho≈øe who deny the Plainne≈øs of <hi>Scripture</hi> do yet allow that the Sen≈øe of it may be plainly convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Words ≈øpoken, or which is the ≈øame thing, <hi>Oral Tradition;</hi> if the <hi>Scripture</hi> be not <hi>plain</hi> it can be re≈øolved into no <hi>other</hi> Rea≈øon but this, that <hi>God</hi> would not have it ≈øo; for there is no Doubt but he could have <hi>≈øpoken</hi> as plainly as Men, and have <hi>written</hi> as plainly as he ≈øpoke; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if he hath not done ≈øo, it was becau≈øe he would not; but to ≈øay that he would not write tho≈øe Things plainly which he thought <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> for all Men to know, and which he wrote on purpo≈øe that all Men might know, is to ≈øay that he would, and would not at the ≈øame time; or that he wrote them on purpo≈øe that Men might know them, and yet that he wrote ≈øo as that they might not know them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From the <hi>frequent</hi> Commands <hi>God</hi> lays up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us to read the <hi>Scripture</hi> it is al≈øo evident, that in all <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> Things it is <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>clear.</hi> That <hi>God</hi> doth not only allow, but will and rquire us to read the <hi>Scripture,</hi> I ≈øhall ≈øhew at large here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, when I come to treat of <hi>≈øearching the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> Suppo≈øing therefore at pre≈øent the Thing to be <hi>true,</hi> I would fain know to what purpo≈øe ≈øhould <hi>God</hi> require us to read the <hi>Scripture,</hi> if in tho≈øe things which are <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> for Men to know
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:154348:160"/>and believe, it be not <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>intelligible.</hi> Doth <hi>God</hi> require us to read it, for the ≈øake of reading it, or for the ≈øake of under≈øtanding it? If the <hi>former,</hi> reading any <hi>other</hi> Book might as well have an≈øwered God's End as reading the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> becau≈øe reading is reading what≈øoever it be that we read; if the <hi>later,</hi> then either the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> is <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>intelligible</hi> as to all tho≈øe Things which he requires us to under≈øtand, or he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires us to read it in vain. For to what Purpo≈øe ≈øhould we read that we may under≈øtand, if that which we are to read be not <hi>plain</hi> enough to be under≈øtood by us? As for In≈øtance; the <hi>Bereans, Acts</hi> 17.11. are highly commended for <hi>≈øearching the Scriptures daily;</hi> now I would fain know was this a Virtue in them, or was it not? If not, why are they commended for it; if it were, it was certainly their Duty. What was the Intendment of it; was it only that they might be expert Readers? Why are they ≈øo commended for read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Scriptures</hi> above any <hi>other</hi> Book, ≈øeeing that reading any <hi>other</hi> Book would have done as well for that Purpo≈øe as reading the <hi>Scriptures?</hi> But the Text it ≈øelf tells us that the Intendment of their reading the <hi>Scripture</hi> was, <hi>that they might know whether tho≈øe things were ≈øo</hi> or no which St. <hi>Paul</hi> had preached to them; but how ≈øhould they know this by reading the <hi>Scripture,</hi> if the <hi>Scripture</hi> which they read were not <hi>plain</hi> enough to be under≈øtood by them? Again St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives this as a <hi>great</hi> Commendation of his Son <hi>Timothy,</hi> that <hi>from a Child he had known the Holy Scriptures;</hi> whence by the Way we may learn, that it is not ≈øo <hi>great</hi> a Reproach to our <hi>Church</hi> as the <hi>Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øts</hi>
                  <pb n="326" facs="tcp:154348:161"/>intend it for, that we permit <hi>Women</hi> and <hi>Children, Tinkers</hi> and <hi>Coblers</hi> to read the <hi>Scripture.</hi> But I pray, what was the Meaning of <hi>Timothy</hi>'s knowing the <hi>Holy Scripture from a Child?</hi> Was it that he knew the Words of it only, or the Sen≈øe of it al≈øo? If the <hi>former,</hi> a <hi>Parrot</hi> may be taught as much as <hi>Timothy</hi> had learned, and con≈øequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly de≈øerve as <hi>high</hi> a Commendation as he; if the <hi>later,</hi> then it ≈øeems the <hi>Scripture</hi> is <hi>plain</hi> enough <hi>for a well-di≈øpo≈øed</hi> Child to know the Sen≈øe of it, ≈øo far forth at lea≈øt as it is <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> to be known, and this is as much as we de≈øire. If therefore <hi>God</hi> requires us to read the <hi>Scripture,</hi> as <hi>Timothy</hi> did, the End that we may know and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand it as he did, then either we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand the Sen≈øe of it by reading it, or el≈øe <hi>God</hi> requires us to read it in vain.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And la≈øtly; From the Obligation we lie under upon pain of Damnation to believe and receive tho≈øe <hi>Nece≈ø≈øaries</hi> to Salvation contained in <hi>Scripture,</hi> it is al≈øo evident that as to all tho≈øe <hi>Nece≈ø≈øaries</hi> it is <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>clear.</hi> That we are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to believe under pain of Damnation all that the <hi>Scriture</hi> propo≈øes as <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> to our Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is agreed on all hands; but how can Men be ju≈øtly obliged to believe ≈øuch Things as are <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcure,</hi> and <hi>doubtful,</hi> and <hi>uncertain,</hi> and of which they can have no <hi>certain</hi> Knowledge? Either the <hi>Nece≈ø≈øaries</hi> to Salvation mu≈øt be plainly and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expre≈øs'd in <hi>Scripture,</hi> or we have not <hi>≈øufficient</hi> Rea≈øon to believe them; and to ≈øay <hi>God</hi> will damn us for not believing tho≈øe Things which he hath not given us <hi>≈øufficient</hi> Rea≈øon to believe, is to charge him with the mo≈øt <hi>outragious</hi> Oppre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:154348:161"/>and Inju≈øtice. But we are told that though <hi>God</hi> hath not clearly revealed to us in <hi>Scripture</hi> tho≈øe Things which he hath obliged us to believe upon Pain of Damnation, yet he hath left us <hi>≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient</hi> Rea≈øon to believe them; for he hath left us to the Conduct of an <hi>Infallible Church,</hi> that is to ≈øay, of the <hi>pre≈øent Church of Rome</hi> in all Ages, whom he hath <hi>authorized</hi> to explain and define to us all Things that are <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> to be believed, which we are to receive upon her Authority, and not upon the <hi>Scriptures;</hi> ≈øo that if we firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe what She defines and propo≈øes to us, we are ≈øure to believe all Things that are <hi>nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øary</hi> to be believed. Now in An≈øwer to this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, which indeed is the <hi>great</hi> Foundation that the Faith of tho≈øe of the <hi>pre≈øent Church of Rome</hi> relies on, I de≈øire the≈øe Things may be ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riou≈øly con≈øidered.</p>

               <p n="3">3.

<pb n="333" facs="tcp:154348:164"/>we follow the <hi>true</hi> Sen≈øe of it, it cannot mi≈ølead us.

And then <hi>Secondly,</hi> As for the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> we are <hi>certain</hi> where to find it; <hi>viz,</hi> in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Text, and in every Propo≈øition therein contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which being all the <hi>World of God,</hi> mu≈øt be all <hi>infallbile.</hi> But as for the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> as they have handled the Matter, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt as <hi>difficult</hi> to find as to prove it; ≈øome cry, lo it is here; and ≈øome, lo it is there; ≈øome place it in the <hi>Pope</hi> only, others in the <hi>Pope</hi> and his <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege</hi> of <hi>Cardinals;</hi> ≈øome in the <hi>Pope</hi> pre≈øiding in a <hi>General Council,</hi> others in a <hi>General Council</hi> whether the <hi>Pope</hi> pre≈øide in it, or no. So that in this <hi>Church,</hi> it ≈øeems, there is <hi>Infallibility</hi> ≈øomewhere, but what are we the better for it if we know not where to find it? If we go to the <hi>Pope</hi> for it; there have been <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three Popes</hi> at once that have decreed again≈øt <hi>one another;</hi> and therefore <hi>one</hi> or <hi>t'other</hi> of them to be ≈øure were mi≈øtaken. How then ≈øhall we know which is the <hi>true infallible</hi> one? And when I have found the <hi>true Pope,</hi> others tell me I am not yet arrived at the Seat of <hi>Infallibility</hi> until I have found him in his <hi>College</hi> of <hi>Cardinals;</hi> and when I have found him here I am ≈øtill to ≈øeek, ≈øeeing I find the ≈øame <hi>Pope</hi> (<hi>Eugenius the Fourth for</hi> In≈øtance)

And as for <hi>General Councils</hi> them≈øelves there are <hi>≈øundry</hi> of them which are owned by <hi>≈øome,</hi> and rejected by <hi>others</hi> of the <hi>principal</hi> Doctors of the <hi>Roman Communion.</hi> And even when <hi>Councils</hi> are legally a≈ø≈øembled, there are ≈øo many <hi>nice</hi> Di≈øputes among them, what it is that makes them <hi>General,</hi> and when it is that they act <hi>Conciliariter</hi> as they call it, that is, ≈øo as to render their Decrees perpetually and univer≈øally obliging; that though we were re≈øolved to build our Faith upon the Authority of <hi>this Church,</hi> yet if we will u≈øe that Caution in believing that we ought to do in a Matter of ≈øo great Moment, we ≈øhould find our ≈øelves involved in greater Uncertainties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the≈øe Things than we are concerning the Sen≈øe even of the mo≈øt <hi>difficult</hi> Places of <hi>Scripture.</hi> But then <hi>Thirdly,</hi> When we are pa≈øs'd over all the≈øe Difficulties we are ≈øtill at as <hi>great</hi> a Lo≈øs to under≈øtand what is the Sen≈øe of the <hi>Church</hi> to be believe by us, as what is the Sen≈øe of <hi>Scripture.</hi> For the <hi>Church</hi> hath no <hi>other</hi> way to deliver her Sen≈øe to us but either by <hi>Oral Tradition,</hi> that is, by Word of Mouth; or by <hi>Writing;</hi> If She deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver her Sen≈øe to me by <hi>Oral Tradition,</hi> how can I know what that is who never heard Her ≈øpeak ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

How ≈øhould I do that who under≈øtand not ≈øo much as the Languages in which they are written? Or ≈øuppo≈øe they were Tran≈ølated, how ≈øhall I know that they are faithfully render'd any more than I do that the <hi>Scripture</hi> is ≈øo? But ≈øuppo≈øe I were <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> of this, and ≈øhould thereupon proceed to read them, ala≈øs, I find in them a <hi>great</hi> many <hi>difficult</hi> and <hi>dubious</hi> Expre≈ø≈øions, yea, and at lea≈øt <hi>≈øeeming</hi> Contradictions to <hi>each other;</hi> how then can I be more certain of the true Sen≈øe of the≈øe Writings than of the Sen≈øe of the Writings of <hi>Scripture?</hi> But you will ≈øay, the <hi>Church</hi> hath dige≈øted her Sen≈øe of all her Articles of Faith into a <hi>plain Creed</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techi≈øm, viz.</hi> that of the <hi>Council of Trent,</hi> whereby the plaine≈øt Reader may without any <hi>laborious</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries be ready in≈øtructed what he ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. This I confe≈øs is ≈øomething; but as for tho≈øe Articles of Faith wherein <hi>We</hi> and the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> are agreed, we find them as plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øs'd in <hi>Scripture</hi> as in that <hi>Creed</hi> and <hi>Catechi≈øm;</hi> and therefore we have Rea≈øon to believe that if tho≈øe Articles wherein we di≈øagree had ever been intended for Articles of Faith, they would have been as plainly expre≈øs'd there as the≈øe; but 'tis no wonder we ≈øhould not find them plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øs'd

                  <hi>there,</hi> when we cannot find them expre≈øs'd <hi>there</hi> at all. But do we not find that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures even in the <hi>plaine≈øt</hi> Expre≈ø≈øions of Articles of Faith have yet been perverted by <hi>Hereticks,</hi> into a <hi>contrary</hi> Meaning? And what then?

For what can be more <hi>contrary</hi> than <hi>Belarmine</hi>'s Expo≈øition of the <hi>Trent Faith,</hi> and the <hi>Bi≈øhop</hi> of <hi>Condom</hi>'s? And yet both allowed by the <hi>Pope,</hi> who by the Authority of that <hi>Council</hi> is made <hi>≈øole</hi> Arbitrator of the Sen≈øe of it. But then <hi>Fourthly</hi> and la≈øtly, As to the Sen≈øe of <hi>Scripture</hi> our Reliance on the Authority of that <hi>Church</hi> leaves us at as <hi>great</hi> an Uncertainty as it found us. For where the <hi>Scripture</hi> de≈øigns to ≈øpeak plainly, as it doth in all Things <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the <hi>Church</hi> cannot ≈øpeak <hi>plainer;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there we may under≈øtand the <hi>Scripture</hi> as well without the <hi>Church</hi> as with it; but where it doth not ≈øpeak plainly, the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> hath left us not <hi>infallible</hi> Commentary whereby to under≈øtand it; ≈øo that where the <hi>Scripture</hi> is <hi>plain</hi> She hath not made it <hi>plainer,</hi> and where it is <hi>ob≈øcure</hi> She hath left it as <hi>ob≈øcure</hi> as ever: So that after all the Noi≈øe that is made of <hi>Infallibility</hi> her Doctors are fain to apply them≈øelves to the ≈øame Methods of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding <hi>Scripture,</hi> that is, to con≈øult the Sen≈øe of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and compare Text with Text, and the like that we <hi>fallible</hi> Prote≈øtants do; and when they have done all, are as <hi>lyable</hi> to be mi≈øtaken as we.
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:154348:166"/>Nay they them≈øelves confe≈øs that even <hi>General Councils</hi> them≈øelves may be mi≈øtaken in their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of <hi>Scripture;</hi> that is, that they may mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apply them to <hi>wrong</hi> Purpo≈øes, which they cannot do without mi≈øtaking the Sen≈øe of them, of which there are a <hi>great</hi> many <hi>notorious</hi> In≈øtances in the <hi>≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Council of Nice;</hi> which to prove it the Duty of <hi>Chri≈øtians</hi> to wor≈øhip <hi>Images,</hi> urges God's tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Clay, and making Man after his <hi>own</hi> Image; and likewi≈øe that of <hi>E≈øay, There ≈øhall be a Sign and Te≈øtimony to the Lord in the Land of Egypt;</hi> and al≈øo tho≈øe Pa≈ø≈øages of <hi>David, Confe≈ø≈øion and Beauty is before him.

It is pretended (though fal≈øly you ≈øee) that <hi>that Church</hi>'s Authority is ≈øo <hi>≈øure</hi> a Ground of Faith, that while a Man depends upon it he cannot be mi≈øtaken in any <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> Article of Faith; which in Reality a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to no more than this, That while a Man believes as <hi>that Church</hi> believes, which Infallibly believes all that is <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> to Salvation, he infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly believes all that is <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> to Salvation; and it is equally <hi>true,</hi> that while a Man believes as the <hi>Scripture</hi> teaches, which infallibly teaches all that is <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> to Salvation, he infallibly believes all that is <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> to Salvation; that is, both are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually <hi>fal≈øe.</hi> For no Man can infallibly believe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Scripture,</hi> becau≈øe <hi>Infallibility</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the Capacity of <hi>humane</hi> Nature; no Man can ≈øo believe <hi>either</hi> but that he may be mi≈øtaken, and if he may be mi≈øtaken, its <hi>po≈ø≈øible</hi> he may not believe all that is <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> to Salvation, whether he grounds his Faith upon the <hi>Church</hi> or the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> But becau≈øe this <hi>Church</hi> pretends ≈øo to ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure my Faith while I depend upon her Authority as that I cannot be mi≈øtaken, for this very Rea≈øon I cannot depend upon it, becau≈øe I am ≈øure of this,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:154348:167"/>that <hi>God</hi> never de≈øigned for me any ≈øuch Means of Believing as ≈øhould render my Faith <hi>infallible.</hi> For to what End ≈øhould he require me to take ≈øo much Pains and Care to ≈øecure my Faith from Errors, if he hath furni≈øhed me with any <hi>certain</hi> Means of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>infallible?</hi> It would be but applying that Means whatever it is, and my Danger would be immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately over; and then I need trouble my. Head no further, being now ≈øo <hi>≈øecured</hi> as that I cannot be mi≈øtaken; after which it would be very <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent</hi> methinks for <hi>God</hi> to trouble me with tho≈øe <hi>unece≈ø≈øary</hi> Injunctions <hi>of trying all Things, and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fa≈øt to that which is good; of ≈øearching the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and trying the Spirits whether they be of God; and taking heed whil≈øt I ≈øtand le≈øt I fall.</hi> What need a Man be at the Expence of all this Labour and Caution, who≈øe Faith is already ≈øecured? Seeing therefore <hi>God</hi> requires the≈øe Things at our Hands, it is a <hi>plain</hi> Ca≈øe that he never intended us any Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod how to be <hi>infallbile</hi> in believing; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ≈øince the <hi>Church of Rome's</hi> Authority is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be ≈øuch a Method, for that Rea≈øon it ought to be rejected. It's plain that <hi>God</hi> intended that our Faith ≈øhould be a Grace and a Virtue, and con≈øequently that it ≈øhould be an Act of our Wills as well as of our Under≈øtandings, which ≈øuppo≈øes the Evidence of it to be <hi>irre≈øi≈øtible;</hi> for what Virtue is it to believe that the Sun ≈øhines when it glares full in our Eyes? Since therefore our Faith mu≈øt be a <hi>free</hi> and <hi>voluntary</hi> A≈ø≈øent upon ≈øuch Motives as are <hi>≈øufficient</hi> to ≈øatisfy an <hi>hone≈øt</hi> Mind, but not to compel either an <hi>ob≈øtinate</hi> Infidel or <hi>≈øelf-deceived</hi> Hypocrite; <hi>God</hi> did not think fit ≈øo to ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure our Faith as to leave is <hi>impo≈ø≈øible</hi> for us to err
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:154348:168"/>
                  <hi>damnably;</hi> And, indeed if he had, it would have been no Virtue in us to believe <hi>≈øavingly;</hi> for what Virtue is it for a Man to do that which it is <hi>impo≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> for him not to do? It is <hi>≈øufficient</hi> that we cannot err damnably in our Faith without ≈øome <hi>damnable</hi> Fault in our Wills; but if we eithre refu≈øe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into this Revelation for what is <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> for us to believe, or will only enquire into it with a Mind that is bya≈øs'd with <hi>wicked and <hi>≈øinful</hi> Prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or will not ≈øubmit our Under≈øtandings to it upon the <hi>cleare≈øt</hi> Conviction, there is no doubt but we may be <hi>ignorant,</hi> and we may be deceived in Things of the <hi>greate≈øt</hi> Moment, and it is but <hi>ju≈øt</hi> and <hi>fit</hi> that we ≈øhould: And if notwith≈øtanding the≈øe Faults we could not err, for God's ≈øake what Virtue would it be to be <hi>Orthodox?</hi> But if with <hi>hone≈øt, humble,</hi> and <hi>teachable</hi> Minds we will diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enquire into <hi>divine</hi> Revelation, we ≈øhall there find all the <hi>Nece≈ø≈øaries</hi> to Salvation ≈øo clearly and plainly propo≈øed to us, that 'twill be <hi>morally impo≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> for us either to be <hi>ignorant</hi> of, or deceived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them. So that by relying on <hi>Scripture</hi> you ≈øee we are expo≈øed to no <hi>other</hi> Uncertainties than ju≈øt what are <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> to render our Faith a Virtue; and <hi>God</hi> doth as much require that our Faith ≈øhould be <hi>virtuous</hi> as that it ≈øhould be <hi>Orthodox;</hi> that it ≈øhould be the Act of an <hi>hone≈øt, humble, diligent,</hi> and <hi>teachable</hi> Mind, as that it ≈øhould be extended to all Things <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> to Salvation. Now our Faith may be <hi>Orthodox</hi> without an <hi>infallible</hi> Certainty, but it cannot be <hi>virtuous</hi> and <hi>rewardable</hi> with it. To what purpo≈øe then do the <hi>Romani≈øts</hi> talk of an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible</hi> certainty in Believing? Is it <hi>rea≈øonable</hi> to expect more certainty than <hi>God</hi> ever intended to
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:154348:168"/>give? He hath given as much as is <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> for <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øt</hi> Minds and no more, and whether <hi>Knaves</hi> and <hi>Hypocrites</hi> believe <hi>right</hi> or <hi>wrong</hi> is of no <hi>great</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment. If therefore our Faith be <hi>liable</hi> to no <hi>other</hi> Uncertainty than ju≈øt what is <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> to try our Hone≈øty, that is much <hi>better</hi> for us in Re≈øpect of the Virtue of our Faith than an <hi>infallible</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty. Suppo≈øing therefore that the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> were as <hi>infallible</hi> as it pretends, it is certain that the <hi>Scripture</hi> is as <hi>infallible</hi> as that; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we relie upon <hi>one</hi> or <hi>t'other</hi> we are <hi>fallible</hi> ≈øtill. And could that <hi>Church</hi> render us as infallibly <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> as it pretends, it would thereby pre≈øerve in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the <hi>Orthodoxy</hi> of our Faith, but then at the ≈øame Time it would de≈øtroy the Virtue of it: For to believe <hi>right</hi> when we cannot believe <hi>wrong</hi> is <hi>fatal</hi> and <hi>nece≈ø≈øary;</hi> but to believe <hi>right</hi> when through <hi>our own</hi> Default</hi> we may be believe <hi>wrong,</hi> this is <hi>virtuous</hi> and <hi>remwardable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By what hath been ≈øaid therefore, I think it is ≈øufficiently evident, that it is upon the <hi>Scripture</hi> we are to relie, and not upon the <hi>Church,</hi> e≈øpecially upon the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> for all Things <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> to Salvation; and therefore ≈øince we are obliged to believe the≈øe Things upon pain of <hi>Eternal</hi> Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it nece≈ø≈øarily follows that they mu≈øt be <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>clear,</hi> and <hi>Scripture;</hi> otherwi≈øe we could not be ju≈øtly ≈øo obliged to believe them. And thus I have ≈øhewn at large that the <hi>Scripture</hi> is the <hi>great</hi> Rule of our Faith and Manners, and that as ≈øuch, it is both <hi>full</hi> and <hi>clear,</hi> as containing in it all Things <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> to Salvation, and propo≈øing them ≈øo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and clearly, as that upon an <hi>hone≈øt</hi> and <hi>diligent</hi> Enquiry all Men may find and di≈øcover them.</p>

               </list>
               <p n="1">1. From the <hi>general</hi> Obligation which the <hi>Jews</hi> were under the Read and Search their <hi>Scriptures.</hi> For ≈øo <hi>God requires</hi> them to <hi>keep the words which he commanded them, in their Hearts,</hi> and <hi>to teach them dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to their Children,</hi> and <hi>to talk of them as they ≈øat in their Hou≈øes, and as they walked in the way, and when they lay down, and when they ro≈øe up, and to bind them as a ≈øign upon their hands,</hi> Deut. 6.6, 7, 8. And el≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, This <hi>book of the Law ≈øhall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou ≈øhatl meditate therein day and night,</hi> ≈øpeaking to the Children of <hi>I≈ørael</hi> in general, <hi>Jo≈ø.</hi>
                  <pb n="344" facs="tcp:154348:170"/>1.8. And again, <hi>Ye ≈øhall lay lip the≈øe my words in your heart and in your ≈øoul, that your days may be mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied, and the days of your Children, in the Land which the Lord ≈øware unto your Fathers to give them, as the days of heaven upon the earth,</hi> Deut. 11.18, 21. And to <hi>meditate on God's Law day and night, David</hi> makes a Part of the Character of the <hi>Ble≈ø≈øed</hi> Man, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 1.3. Now if they could not keep God's Laws in their Hearts, as mo≈øt certainly they could not; if they could not teach them to their. Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; if they could not talk of them upon all <hi>ju≈øt</hi> and <hi>proper</hi> Occa≈øions, and in a word, if they could not meditate on them day and night without being very well acquainted with them by diligent Search and Reading them, it is mo≈øt <hi>certain</hi> that to Read and Search into them was their <hi>indi≈øpen≈øible</hi> Duty. Now if there be the ≈øame Rea≈øon why <hi>we</hi> ≈øhould Read the <hi>Scriptures</hi> as there was why the <hi>Jews</hi> ≈øhould, then the Obligation of the≈øe Commands mu≈øt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to <hi>us</hi> as well as to <hi>them;</hi> becau≈øe the Rea≈øon of the Law is the Law; but 'tis evident, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Contradiction, that there is no <hi>good</hi> Rea≈øon a≈ø≈øignable for the <hi>one,</hi> which is not of <hi>equal</hi> force for the <hi>other;</hi> and what≈øoever is objected by our Adver≈øaries in this Point again≈øt our Reading the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> is of <hi>equal</hi> validity again≈øt the <hi>Jews</hi> Reading them. It is Objected, That our Reading them, through our Incapacity to under≈øtand them, mu≈øt occa≈øion a great many <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Here≈øies</hi> in the <hi>Church.</hi> And why ≈øhould not their Reading them occa≈øion the ≈øame, ≈øince neither their Under≈øtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were <hi>larger</hi> than ours, nor their Scriptures <hi>clearer</hi> and more <hi>intelligible</hi> than ours? It is farther objected, that becau≈øe of the many <hi>ill</hi> Examples re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:154348:170"/>in <hi>Scripture</hi> it is <hi>dangerous</hi> for the People to read it; becau≈øe of their Aptne≈øs to be mi≈øled and corrupted by Example. But I be≈øeech you, are there not more <hi>bad</hi> Examples in the <hi>Old Te≈øtament</hi> than in the <hi>New?</hi> And were not the <hi>Jews</hi> as apt to be corrupted by them as we <hi>Chri≈øtians?</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ≈øince the≈øe Objections do pre≈øs as much again≈øt their reading the <hi>Scriptures</hi> as ours, it is certain they ought to keep <hi>both</hi> from it or <hi>neither.</hi> Seeing therefore notwith≈øtanding the≈øe Objections <hi>God</hi> obliged the <hi>Jews</hi> to read them, it's plain they are not of Force enough to di≈øoblige us from doing the ≈øame.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From our <hi>Saviour</hi> and his <hi>Apo≈øtles</hi> Approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Practice of the <hi>Jews</hi> in Pur≈øuance of their Obligation to it, it is al≈øo evident that we are oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ≈øame. That the <hi>Common People</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> did ordinarily read the <hi>Scriptures</hi> in our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou's</hi> Time, is evident not only from the Text, <hi>Search the Scriptures</hi> (which if you take them <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catively,</hi> are an <hi>expre≈øs</hi> Declaration that they did read them; and if you take them <hi>Imperatively,</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øarily imply that they them≈øelves owned that they ought to read them) but al≈øo from tho≈øe Que≈øtions which our <hi>Saviour</hi> frequently ask'd them in his Conferences with them; ≈øuch as, <hi>Have ye not read? Have ye never read in the Scripture?</hi> And <hi>hath not the Scripture ≈øaid ≈øo</hi> and <hi>≈øo?</hi> Which Que≈øtion would be very <hi>Impertinent</hi> if read<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Scripture</hi> were not then ordinarily pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti≈øed by that People. And that even their <hi>holy</hi> Women were then ≈øo well in≈øtructed in the <hi>Scriptures</hi> as to be able to in≈øtruct their Children, <hi>Timothy</hi> is a <hi>≈øignal</hi> In≈øtance, who, though his <hi>Father</hi> were an <hi>Heathen,</hi> had <hi>known the holy Scriptures from
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:154348:171"/>a Child,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. which knowledge he mu≈øt nece≈ø≈øarily have derived from his <hi>Grand-Mother Lois,</hi> and his <hi>Mother Eunice,</hi> who≈øe Faith St. <hi>Paul</hi> cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brates; 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. And this Practice of read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scriptures which was ≈øo <hi>common</hi> among that People in our Saviour's time is ≈øo far from being di≈øcontinued either by <hi>him≈øelf</hi> or his <hi>Apo≈øtles,</hi> that it is always mentioned by them with Applau≈øe and Approbation. Thus the <hi>Bereans</hi> are commended as a People of a <hi>nobler</hi> Strain than tho≈øe of <hi>The≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonica,</hi> becau≈øe they <hi>≈øearched the Scriptures daily whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> tho≈øe Things which St. <hi>Paul</hi> had preached to them were ≈øo or no. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> is ≈øo far from reprehending <hi>Timothy</hi> for medling with the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> whil≈øt he was a <hi>Lay-man,</hi> that he mentions it to his Honour, <hi>that he had known the Scriptures from a Child.</hi> And in all tho≈øe Pa≈ø≈øages wherein our <hi>Saviour</hi> takes it for granted that the <hi>Common People</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> did read the <hi>Scripture,</hi> we have not the <hi>lea≈øt</hi> Intimation of his di≈ølike of their Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, which we ≈øhould certainly have had, had he apprehended it to be either <hi>dangerous</hi> or <hi>unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</hi> Seeing therefore neither our <hi>Saviour</hi> nor his <hi>Apo≈øtles</hi> do in the <hi>lea≈øt</hi> di≈øallow of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> being read by the <hi>Common People,</hi> but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary do expre≈øly commend it; this is a <hi>plain</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that it was their Intention to perpetuate the Practice of it to <hi>future</hi> Ages. For ≈øeeing the <hi>Jews</hi> read the <hi>Scriptures</hi> in Obedience to an <hi>expre≈øs</hi> Command of <hi>God,</hi> as was ≈øhewn before, had our <hi>Saviour</hi> intended that they ≈øhould not continue it, he would doubtle≈øs have repealed that Command by ≈øome Countermand, which he was ≈øo far from doing that he not only every where allows of their
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:154348:171"/>reading the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> but al≈øo expre≈øly approves and commends it; whereby he plainly e≈øtabli≈øhes the <hi>Obligation</hi> of that <hi>ancient</hi> Command in Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to which they did read them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From the <hi>great</hi> De≈øign and Intention of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> it is al≈øo evident, that the <hi>People</hi> are ≈øtill obliged to Read them. It is plain the <hi>great</hi> De≈øign of Writing the <hi>Scripture</hi> was to in≈øtruct Men in the Knowledge, and per≈øuade them to the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of <hi>True Religion;</hi> For thus of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> of the <hi>Old Te≈øtament</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, That <hi>what≈øoever things were written aforetime, were written for our learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> Rom. 15.4. and <hi>for our admonition,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.11. And as for the <hi>New Te≈øtament,</hi> we are told, That it was written <hi>that we might believe that Je≈øus is the Chri≈øt the Son of God, and that believing we might have life through his name,</hi> Joh. 20.31. And St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, That he wrote both his Epi≈øtles to <hi>≈øtir up the pure Minds of Chri≈øtians by way of remembrance, and to put them in mind of the words which were ≈øpoken before by the Holy Prophets, and of the Commandment of the Apo≈øtles of our Lord and Saviour,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.1. And St. <hi>John</hi> gives us this account of his Writing his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtles, <hi>The≈øe things have I written to you that ye ≈øin not,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.1. And St. <hi>Jude,</hi> this of his, <hi>Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you that ye ≈øhould earne≈øtly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints,</hi> v. 3. The≈øe are the Ends for which the <hi>Scripture</hi> was written; but how can the Writing of it contribute to the≈øe Ends if we are not permitted to Read what is written? For the <hi>Scripture</hi> was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the <hi>People</hi> as well as to the <hi>Clergy,</hi> as I ≈øhall

From the Direction of the≈øe <hi>Holy Writings</hi> to the <hi>People,</hi> it is al≈øo evident, that the <hi>People</hi> are ≈øtill obliged to Read, or acquaint them≈øelves with them.

<pb n="351" facs="tcp:154348:173"/>the Language of <hi>Scripture</hi> includes every <hi>Chri≈øtian;</hi> but al≈øo <hi>to all that are at Rome, to all that in every place call upon the name of Je≈øus Chri≈øt our Lord, to all the Saints which are in Achaia, to all the Saints which are at Philippi, to the twelve Tribes which are ≈øcattered abroad, to the Strangers ≈øcattered through Pontus, Galatia,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>to them which have obtained like precious Faith with us,</hi> that is, to all the <hi>Jewi≈øh Chri≈øtians</hi> di≈øper≈øed over the World. Seeing therefore the <hi>Scriptures</hi> were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to all, as well <hi>Laity</hi> as <hi>Clergy,</hi> this not only gives a Right to <hi>all</hi> to Read them, but al≈øo lays an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation upon <hi>all</hi> to acquaint them≈øelves with them. For the very directing ≈øuch a Writing or Epi≈øtle to <hi>≈øuch</hi> or <hi>≈øuch</hi> Per≈øons, doth, in the Sen≈øe of all the World, imply, that he who writes doth de≈øign and intend, that they to whom he directs it ≈øhould Read and Peru≈øe it; and therefore, ≈øince the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> were written to <hi>all,</hi> that is a <hi>plain</hi> Intimation, that it was the Intention of the Writers that <hi>all</hi> ≈øhould Read them. And for us not to Read what <hi>God</hi> hath written, and directed to us, is by impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Fact, a <hi>Prophane</hi> Neglect and Contempt of his Mercy, and looks as if we either thought him ≈øuch an <hi>In≈øignificant</hi> Being, or our ≈øelves ≈øo <hi>little</hi> concerned in any thing that he can ≈øay or write to us, as that it would not be worth our while to receive, and peru≈øe the Contents of tho≈øe <hi>Sacred</hi> Epi≈øtles, which by the Hands of his <hi>Holy Penmen</hi> he hath vouch≈øafed to direct to us.

<pb n="352" facs="tcp:154348:173"/>of them to us: For to be ≈øure, had <hi>God</hi> intended that the <hi>Prie≈øts</hi> only ≈øhould read them, he would have directed them only to the <hi>Prie≈øts,</hi> and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them only to deliver the Sen≈øe of them to the <hi>the People;</hi> and therefore ≈øince he hath directed them to <hi>both,</hi> this nece≈ø≈øarily implies that it was his Intention that <hi>both</hi> ≈øhould read them. For if <hi>God</hi> had not directed them to Men, neither <hi>Prie≈øts</hi> nor <hi>People</hi> were obliged to read them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ≈øeeing the <hi>great</hi> Rea≈øon why any Men ought to Read them is, becau≈øe they are directed to Men, this Rea≈øon obliges all Men to Read them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe they are directed to all Men. For not to be highly concerned to know and under≈øtand what it is that <hi>God</hi> writes to us is an Argument that we have a very <hi>mean</hi> Regard both of his Maje≈øty, and his Mind, and Will.

So that for Men wilfully to neglect reading the <hi>Scripture</hi> which <hi>God</hi> hath ≈øo expre≈øly directed to them, and thereby not only licen≈øed but obliged them to read it, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues a very <hi>prophane</hi> Di≈øregard both of the Author of it, and of the Matter it contains; and for any Man, or Society of Men to forbid the <hi>People</hi> to read what <hi>God</hi> hath written and directed to them, is not only to deprive them of a Right which <hi>God</hi> hath given them, but al≈øo to acquit them of a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which he hath laid upon them For St. <hi>Paul</hi> in tho≈øe Epi≈øtles which he wrote to the <hi>Chri≈øtian Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>

If you ≈øay it is, con≈øider before you ≈øay it, how it could con≈øi≈øt with the Truth and Veracity of <hi>God</hi> to publi≈øh ≈øuch a Book to the World as tends in its <hi>own</hi> Nature to ≈øeduce and mi≈ølead the Under≈øtandings of tho≈øe that read it. If you ≈øay it is not <hi>≈øo</hi> in it ≈øelf, but only that it may be ≈øo accidentally, I would fain know what Means of In≈øtruction is there which may not accidentally become an Occa≈øion of mi≈øleading Men into <hi>Here≈øy;</hi> and therefore if this be a <hi>≈øufficient</hi> Rea≈øon to deprive Men of <hi>Scripture,</hi> it is <hi>≈øufficient</hi> to deprive them of all <hi>other</hi> Means of In≈øtruction. And ≈øeeing the Knowledge of <hi>Religion</hi> is the Food of Mens Souls, to keep them in Ignorance for fear they ≈øhould err, is to deny them Food for fear they ≈øhould ≈øurfeit. There is no doubt but Men who≈øe Minds are tinctured with <hi>Heretical</hi> pravity will be apt enough to extract the Poi≈øon of <hi>Error</hi> out of the

                  <hi>clearest</hi> Conveyances and Di≈øcoveries of Truth; but what then? Do not <hi>bad</hi> Men ordinarily apply the <hi>best</hi> Things to the <hi>worst</hi> purpo≈øes? If Men fall into <hi>Here≈øy</hi> by reading the <hi>Scripture,</hi> where lies the Fault? not in the <hi>Scripture</hi> ≈øure, no <hi>Chri≈øtian</hi> will Pretend that; and if it be in them≈øelves, in their <hi>Pride,</hi> or <hi>Vain-glory,</hi> or <hi>Covetou≈øne≈øs,</hi> or <hi>Sen≈øuality,</hi> (as it is demon≈øtrable it is) is it <hi>just</hi> that <hi>All</hi> ≈øhould be deprived of it, becau≈øe <hi>≈øome ill</hi> Men have made an <hi>ill</hi> U≈øe of it? Some Men have ≈øurfeited by Eating and Drinking, is it <hi>just</hi> that all Mankind therefore ≈øhould be deprived of Meat and Drink? Suppo≈øe a Prince, pretending to be an <hi>infallible Geographer,</hi> ≈øhould i≈ø≈øue out a Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on commanding all his Subjects to travel at <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,</hi> and ≈øhould a≈ø≈øign <hi>this</hi> as the Rea≈øon of it, that he had been certainly informed that <hi>≈øeveral</hi> of them had lo≈øt their Way at <hi>Noon,</hi> and wandred into Bogs and Precipices by the Light of the Sun; would any <hi>one</hi> imagin <hi>this</hi> to be the <hi>true</hi> Rea≈øon, or rather would not every <hi>one</hi> believe that his <hi>true</hi> De≈øign was to keep his People in Ignorance of the Roads and Situation of his Country, that ≈øo they might never be able to di≈øcover the Errors of his Maps, which would perhaps di≈øcover him to be not only a <hi>fallible Geographer,</hi> but al≈øo a very <hi>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous</hi> one?

                  <hi>viz.</hi> That the Allowance of the <hi>Scripture</hi> to the <hi>People,</hi> is a <hi>dangerous</hi> Inlet of <hi>Error</hi> and <hi>Here≈øy.</hi> I proceed therefore to the Second, which is this;</p>
               <p>Object. 2. That there are <hi>many</hi> Things record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Scripture</hi> which are very <hi>apt</hi> to ≈øugge≈øt <hi>lewd</hi> Thoughts to the People, and thereby to corrupt their Manners, as particularly the many <hi>bad</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples therein related, which are of a very <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious</hi> Nature, and con≈øequently <hi>dangerous</hi> for the <hi>People</hi> to conver≈øe with. In an≈øwer to which I de≈øire the≈øe <hi>four</hi> Things may be ≈øeriou≈øly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That this <hi>Objection</hi> ≈øtrikes as much again≈øt the <hi>Scripture</hi> it ≈øelf as again≈øt the People's reading it. For what <hi>wor≈øe</hi> Thing can be ≈øaid of the <hi>Scripture</hi> than this, that it is ≈øuch an <hi>infectious</hi> Book, ≈øo <hi>apt</hi> to excite <hi>impure</hi> Thoughts in Mens Minds, and to kindle <hi>lewd</hi> Affections in their Hearts, that it is by no Means fit the <hi>People</hi> ≈øhould read it? Should this be ≈øaid to a <hi>Turk,</hi> or a <hi>Heathen,</hi> who had never read <hi>one</hi> Word in the <hi>Bible,</hi> he would certainly conclude it to be nothing but a <hi>Canto of Ribaldries</hi> written for no <hi>other</hi> End but to provoke and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the <hi>la≈øcivious</hi> Inclinations of Mankind. And certainly had our <hi>Objectors</hi> but as much Reverence for this <hi>Holy Book</hi> as they pretend, they would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther oblige their <hi>People</hi> to read it than with-hold it from them, upon a pretence that doth ≈øo ≈øcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lou≈øly reflect upo its Reputation. If there be any ≈øuch Pa≈ø≈øages in <hi>Scripture</hi> as are <hi>apt</hi> to ≈øtart <hi>lewd</hi> Thoughts in Mens Minds, the utmo≈øt that can be fairly pretended, is, That tho≈øe Pa≈ø≈øages ought
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:154348:185"/>to have been left out of the Peoples <hi>Bibles,</hi> or at lea≈øt to have been left <hi>untran≈ølated:</hi> But to urge <hi>this</hi> as a Rea≈øon, why all the re≈øt of the <hi>Scripture</hi> ≈øhould be denied to the <hi>People,</hi> in≈øinuates, as if the <hi>whole</hi> were nothing el≈øe but a <hi>meer</hi> Kennel of <hi>conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious</hi> Ob≈øcenities. For to urge that for a Rea≈øon, why the <hi>Scripture</hi> in <hi>general</hi> ≈øhould not be read by, or to the <hi>People,</hi> (which at mo≈øt is only a Rea≈øon why ≈øome <hi>few</hi> Pa≈ø≈øages of it ≈øhould not be read by them) is to ≈øuppo≈øe the whole <hi>Scripture</hi> to be made <hi>up</hi> of ≈øuch Pa≈ø≈øages as are <hi>apt</hi> to infu≈øe <hi>vicious</hi> Thoughts into the <hi>People;</hi> than which what can there be ≈øuppo≈øed more <hi>fal≈øe</hi> in it ≈øelf, or more <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory</hi> to the <hi>Scripture?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This <hi>Objection,</hi> if it proves any Thing, doth as well prove that it was <hi>unfit</hi> for <hi>God</hi> to publi≈øh the <hi>Scripture</hi> to the <hi>People,</hi> as it is for the <hi>People</hi> to read it. For is it fit, that <hi>He, who is a God of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity,</hi> ≈øhould publi≈øh ≈øuch Things to the World as are <hi>apt</hi> to engender <hi>impure</hi> Thoughts in Mens Minds? And yet though Mens Minds were as <hi>apt</hi> to imbibe <hi>impure</hi> Thoughts when the≈øe Things were <hi>fir≈øt</hi> publi≈øhed, as they are now; this hindred not <hi>God</hi> from publi≈øhing them to the World in ≈øuch languages as are be≈øt <hi>known</hi> and <hi>understood</hi> by the <hi>People.</hi> Either there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>God</hi> did not ≈øo well know what is <hi>apt</hi> to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Mens Minds as our <hi>wi≈øe</hi> Objectors; or he was <hi>le≈øs</hi> concerned than they to pre≈øerve them for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing corrupted; or what they object is both <hi>fal≈øe</hi> and <hi>≈øcandalous.</hi> For to ≈øay, That the <hi>wi≈øe</hi> and <hi>holy God</hi> hath publi≈øhed ≈øuch Things to the World as his Mini≈øters find <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> to conceal from the World, le≈øt its Thoughts ≈øhould be corrupted by

If the <hi>Vicious</hi> Examples, for in≈øtance, that are recorded in <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> are more <hi>apt</hi> to deprave Men than to in≈øtruct them, what need they have been recorded?

If it ≈øerve no <hi>good</hi> Ends, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded to a <hi>bad</hi> purpo≈øe; and therefore, if for this Rea≈øon, becau≈øe it is <hi>apt</hi> to corrupt Mens Minds, the <hi>Church</hi> be obliged to conceal it now, for the very ≈øame Rea≈øon <hi>God</hi> was obliged to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed it <hi>for ever.</hi> Either therefore we mu≈øt ≈øay that <hi>God</hi> did very <hi>ill</hi> in publi≈øhing it, or that the <hi>Church</hi> doth <hi>very ill</hi> in ≈øuppre≈ø≈øing it; for <hi>God</hi> could have no <hi>other</hi> End in publi≈øhing it to the World, but only to in≈øtruct the World by it.

               <p n="3">3. That this <hi>Objection</hi> doth expre≈øly contradict the <hi>Scripture</hi> it ≈øelf; For whereas it tells us, that the <hi>bad</hi> Examples recorded in <hi>Scripture</hi> would be apt to deprave the Peoples Minds and Manners, St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us the quite contrary: <hi>The≈øe Things were our Examples, to the intent we ≈øhould not lu≈øt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter evil things, as they,</hi> i. e. the <hi>I≈øraelites</hi> in the Wilderne≈øs, <hi>lu≈øted. Neither be ye Idolaters, as were ≈øome of them: Neither let us commit fornication as ≈øome of them committed, and ≈øell in one day three and twenty thou≈øand: Neither let us tempt Chri≈øt, as ≈øome
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:154348:186"/>of them al≈øo tempted, and were de≈øtroyed of ≈øerpents: Neither murmur ye, as ≈øome of them al≈øo murmured, and were de≈øtroyed of the de≈øtroyer: Now all the≈øe things happened unto them for en≈øamples; and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.6, 7, 8.9, 10, 11. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as this <hi>Objection</hi> urges that there are <hi>≈øundry</hi> Pa≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in <hi>Scripture</hi> which ≈øhould the <hi>People</hi> read, would excite <hi>evil</hi> Thoughts in their Minds; The ≈øame St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>That all Scripture is profitable,</hi> not only <hi>for Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Reproof,</hi> but al≈øo <hi>for correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for in≈øtruction in righteou≈øne≈øs,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.16. Whereas this <hi>Objection</hi> pretends, that it would be very <hi>un≈øafe</hi> for <hi>young People</hi> e≈øpecially, to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the <hi>Scripture,</hi> becau≈øe there are ≈øeveral <hi>amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi> Stories and Pa≈ø≈øages in it which will be apt to ≈øugge≈øt <hi>wanton</hi> Thoughts to their <hi>gay</hi> and <hi>amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi> Fancies. <hi>David,</hi> it is plain, was of a quite <hi>contrary</hi> Mind; for <hi>wherewith</hi> ≈øaith he, <hi>≈øhall a young man clean≈øe his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word,</hi> P≈øal. 119.9. than which two Pa≈ø≈øages what A≈ø≈øertions can be more contrary <hi>one</hi> to <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. And la≈øtly, That ≈øuppo≈øing this <hi>Objection</hi> to be thus far <hi>true,</hi> that there are ≈øome Pa≈ø≈øages in <hi>Scripture</hi> which may ≈øometimes occa≈øionally excite <hi>bad</hi> Thoughts in Mens Minds, yet this is no <hi>ju≈øt</hi> Rea≈øon why the U≈øe of <hi>Scripture</hi> ≈øhould be forbid to the <hi>People.</hi> For every Thing which the <hi>People</hi> oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øionally make <hi>bad</hi> U≈øes of, is for that Rea≈øon to be forbid to them; even <hi>Prayer</hi> and the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and the <hi>Profe≈ø≈øion</hi> of <hi>Chri≈øtianity</hi> ought to be for bidden them as well as the <hi>Scripture,</hi> ≈øeeing of the <hi>one</hi> as well as of the <hi>other,</hi> many <hi>People</hi> do occa≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:154348:186"/>make very <hi>bad</hi> U≈øes. So long as the <hi>Scripture</hi> is <hi>good</hi> in it ≈øelf, and <hi>apt</hi> in its <hi>own</hi> Nature to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruct and edifie tho≈øe that read it, this is <hi>≈øuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> not only to warrant the Peoples U≈øe of it, but to enjoyn and require it; and if it ≈øometimes oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øion <hi>corrupt</hi> Thoughts in <hi>corrupt</hi> Minds, this is no more a Rea≈øon why the <hi>People</hi> ≈øhould be deprived of the Light of it than ≈øome <hi>bad</hi> Mens making ill U≈øe of the Light of the Sun is, why the Sun ≈øhould be extingui≈øhed, or why the <hi>People</hi> ≈øhould be <hi>for ever</hi> ≈øhut <hi>up</hi> from the Light of it in <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>di≈ømal</hi> Dungeons. But as for tho≈øe very Pa≈ø≈øages in <hi>Scripture,</hi> which do ≈øometimes occa≈øion <hi>ill</hi> Thoughts in Mens Minds, they are ≈øo far from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it of their <hi>own</hi> Natures, that as they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in <hi>Scripture,</hi> there is nothing more natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>apt</hi> to repre≈øs <hi>bad</hi> Thoughts, and to arm and fortifie Mens Minds again≈øt them. As for in≈øtance, The <hi>bad</hi> Examples recorded in <hi>Scripture</hi> are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally delivered with <hi>infamous</hi> Characters, <hi>≈øevere</hi> Prohibitions, and <hi>dreadful</hi> In≈øtances of God's Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance attending them, which render them much more <hi>apt</hi> to repre≈øs than to excite <hi>evil</hi> Thoughts in Mens Minds; to quicken them to <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Watchfulne≈øs</hi> again≈øt Temptations, and when at any Time they have been overcome by them, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them to Repentance; or when they have overcome them, to ≈øtir them <hi>up</hi> to a <hi>grateful</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of that <hi>preventing</hi> and <hi>a≈ø≈øi≈øting</hi> Grace of God, by which they have been enabled to re≈øi≈øt and repel them. The≈øe are the <hi>natural</hi> U≈øes of tho≈øe <hi>bad</hi> Examples recorded in <hi>Scripture;</hi> and therefore, if in≈øtead of Making the≈øe U≈øes of them, ≈øome Men pervert them to <hi>bad</hi> Purpo≈øes,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:154348:187"/>that is <hi>their</hi> Faults and not the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> It is <hi>≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> that the <hi>bad</hi> Examples in <hi>Scripture,</hi> as they are there recorded, are in them≈øelves of <hi>excellent</hi> U≈øe to the <hi>People;</hi> but ≈øhould Men be deprived of the U≈øe of every <hi>good</hi> Thing they abu≈øe, I would fain know what one <hi>good</hi> Thing would be left free to their Enjoyment. And now having proved at large the Peoples Right and Obligation to U≈øe and Search the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> and an≈øwered the <hi>main Objections</hi> again≈øt it; I ≈øhall conclude with the≈øe two Inferences from the whole.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If he <hi>People</hi> are obliged to acquaint them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves with <hi>Scripture,</hi> then they are obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive upon the Authority of <hi>Scripture</hi> tho≈øe <hi>Divine</hi> Truths which it propo≈øes to their Belief. For to what <hi>other</hi> end ≈øhould we be obliged to read and con≈øult the <hi>Word of God,</hi> but only that we may learn from it what is his Mind and Will? but how ≈øhould we learn from <hi>Scripture</hi> what God's Mind is, if we are not to believe what he therein de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares upon <hi>Scripture</hi> Authority? If I mu≈øt not believe when I read the <hi>Scripture</hi> that this is God's Mind, becau≈øe the <hi>Scripture</hi> ≈øays ≈øo, it is <hi>impo≈ø≈øible</hi> I ≈øhould ever learn God's Mind by reading it; and con≈øequently I am obliged to read it to <hi>no</hi> Purpo≈øe: For there is nothing can teach me what God's Mind is, but that which gives me <hi>≈øufficient</hi> Ground to believe that what it teaches is the Mind of <hi>God.</hi> When therefore I read the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and find ≈øuch a Propo≈øition plainly a≈ø≈øerted in it, is this a <hi>≈øuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> Ground or no for me to believe it to be the Mind of <hi>God?</hi> If it be, then the Authority of <hi>Scripture</hi> is a <hi>≈øufficient</hi> Ground for my Belief; If it

If ≈øo, then when the <hi>Church</hi> by its <hi>infallible</hi> Authority pretends to expound the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> Her meaning is not to expound the Sen≈øe of it, but to impo≈øe a Sen≈øe on it which was never in it; for how can She expound the Sen≈øe of a Book which hath no Sen≈øe in it?

                  <hi>be≈øt</hi> Expo≈øitor of <hi>Scripture.</hi> But the <hi>true</hi> State of the Difference between <hi>them</hi> and <hi>us,</hi> is this, That whereas we require <hi>plain</hi> Men to judge of <hi>plain</hi> Things with their <hi>own</hi> Under≈øtandings, and all Men ≈øo far forth as they are <hi>capable,</hi> to judge for them≈øelves in Matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> and not content them≈øelves to ≈øee with the <hi>Church</hi>'s Eyes, where they are able to ≈øee with their <hi>own;</hi> nothing will ≈øatisfie the≈øe Men, but to have all Men, as well <hi>Wi≈øe</hi> as <hi>Simple,</hi> ≈øurrender <hi>up</hi> their Faith and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the <hi>Church,</hi> and wink <hi>hard,</hi> and believe what-ever the <hi>Church</hi> believes, purely becau≈øe the <hi>Church</hi> believes it. Whatever they pretend there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Truth of the Ca≈øe is this; They will by no means allow us to believe upon the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Scripture;</hi> not becau≈øe the <hi>Scripture</hi> is <hi>ob≈øcure,</hi> (though this they pretend, for were it never ≈øo <hi>plain</hi> the Ca≈øe would be the ≈øame) but becau≈øe they are <hi>≈øen≈øible</hi> that this will inevitably ≈øubvert their <hi>u≈øurped</hi> Dominion over the Faith and Con≈øciences of Men. But we mu≈øt believe upon the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Church;</hi> and who is this <hi>Church</hi> I be≈øeech you? Why they them≈øelves are this <hi>Church.</hi> So that whereas <hi>God</hi> hath publi≈øhed a Book called the <hi>Bible,</hi> on purpo≈øe to declare his Mind and Will to the World, here are ≈øtarted <hi>up</hi> a Sort of Men that call them≈øelves the <hi>Church,</hi> who very gravely tell us; <hi>Sirs, You mu≈øt not ≈øo much as look into this Book, or if you do, mu≈øt not believe any one Word in it upon its own Credit and Authority. For though we do confe≈øs it is the Word of God, yet we are the ≈øole Judges of the Sen≈øe of it; and therefore what≈øoever we decalre is its Sen≈øe, how unlikely ≈øoever it may ≈øeem to you, you are bound in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience to receive and believe it for this very Rea≈øon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:154348:189"/>wedeclare it. In ≈øhort, you mu≈øt re≈øign up your Eyes, your Faith, your Rea≈øon, and <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>nder≈øtandings to us, and ≈øee only with our Eyes, and believe only with our Faith, and judge only with our Judgment; and whither≈øoever we ≈øhall think fit to lead you, you mu≈øt tamely follow us without pre≈øuming to examine whether we lead you right or wrong.</hi> But yet after all to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce us thus to in≈ølave our Under≈øtandings to them they them≈øelves are fain to appeal to <hi>Scripture,</hi> and allow us in ≈øome Things to judge of the Sen≈øe of it, and to believe tho≈øe Things upon its Authority. For no <hi>wi≈øe</hi> and <hi>hone≈øt</hi> Man will ever believe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that They are the <hi>Church,</hi> or the <hi>infallible</hi> Judges of the Sen≈øe of <hi>Scripture</hi> without ≈øome Proof and Evidence;and for this this they are fain to produce ≈øeveral Texts of <hi>Scripture,</hi> ≈øuch as, <hi>Thou art Peter, and upon this Rock will I build my Church.</hi> Now ≈øuppo≈øing that to be <hi>true,</hi> which is notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øly <hi>fal≈øe, viz.</hi> that tho≈øe Texts do nece≈ø≈øarily imply that They are the only <hi>true Catholick Church,</hi> and that as ≈øuch they are con≈øtituted by God <hi>infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> Judges of <hi>Scripture;</hi> yet before I can believe ≈øo, I mu≈øt judge for my ≈øelf whether this be the Sen≈øe of them or no; and if I judge it is, I mu≈øt believe that they are the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>infallible</hi> upon the <hi>Scripture</hi>'s Authority and not theirs; for their Authority is the Thing in debate, and I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve upon it before I believe it. So then, though we mu≈øt believe nothing el≈øe upon <hi>Scripture</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, yet upon this very Authority we mu≈øt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that they are the <hi>Church,</hi> and that they are <hi>infallible,</hi> which are the <hi>fundamental</hi> Principles of their <hi>Religion;</hi> that is to ≈øay, we mu≈øt believe as much upon <hi>Scripture</hi> Authority as will ≈øever their
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:154348:189"/>turn, and no more. But may I be <hi>certain</hi> of the Truth of the≈øe <hi>two Fundamental</hi> Principles upon <hi>Scripture</hi> Authority, or no? If I may, why may I not as well be infallibly <hi>certain</hi> upon the ≈øame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>other</hi> Principles of <hi>Chri≈øtianity</hi> as well as tho≈øe, ≈øeeing there are no <hi>common</hi> Principles of <hi>Chr≈øtian Religion</hi> but what are at lea≈øt as plainly reealed in <hi>Scripture</hi> as the≈øe. But this will ≈øpoil all; for if Men may be infallibly certain of the Principles of <hi>Religion</hi> upon <hi>Scripture</hi> Authority, what will become of the Nece≈ø≈øity of Mens relying upon the <hi>Church,</hi> which is founded upon this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple that Men can arrive at no <hi>infallible</hi> Certainty in <hi>Religion</hi> by relying upon the Authority of <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> or indeed any <hi>other</hi> Authority but the <hi>Church</hi>'s? But if I cannot be infallibly <hi>certain</hi> of tho≈øe <hi>two</hi> Principles, <hi>viz.</hi> that they are the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,</hi> by tho≈øe Authorities of <hi>Scripture</hi> which they urge to prove them, how can I be infallibly <hi>certain</hi> of any Thing that they declare and define? For if I am not <hi>certain</hi> that they are the <hi>Church,</hi> for all I know the <hi>Church,</hi> may be <hi>infallible,</hi> and yet they may be mi≈øtaken; and if I am not <hi>certain</hi> that they are <hi>infallible,</hi> for all I know they may be the <hi>Church,</hi> and yet ≈øtill be mi≈øtaken. In ≈øhort, no Authority can render me infallibly <hi>certain,</hi> but that which is <hi>infallible;</hi> no <hi>Infallibility</hi> can render me infallibly <hi>certain,</hi> but that of which I have an <hi>infallible</hi> Certainty. Either therefore the <hi>Scripture</hi> can render me infallibly <hi>certain</hi> of the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of their <hi>Church</hi> (and if it cannot, I am ≈øure nothing can) or it cannot; if it can, why may it not as well render me infallibly <hi>certain</hi> of <hi>other</hi> Principles of <hi>Chri≈øtianity</hi> which are at lea≈øt as plainly reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:154348:190"/>in it as that? If I cannot, how can I be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly <hi>certain</hi> that any Thing ≈øhe defines and declares to me is true? If then the Authority of <hi>Scripture</hi> can give us an <hi>infallible</hi> Certainty, we have as <hi>ju≈øt</hi> a Pretence to it as They, it being upon this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority that we ground our Faith; if it cannot, neither they nor we can ju≈øtly pretend to it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe they cannot otherwi≈øe be infallibly <hi>certain</hi> of their <hi>own Infallibility</hi> but by <hi>Scripture.</hi> But the Truth of it is, <hi>God</hi> never intended either that <hi>they</hi> or <hi>we</hi> ≈øhould be infallibly <hi>certain</hi> in the Mtters of our <hi>Religion;</hi> for after all the Means of Certainty that he hath given us he ≈øtill ≈øuppo≈øes that we may err, and plainly tells us that there mu≈øt be <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øies,</hi> and that even from among the Members of the <hi>true Church,</hi> where <hi>infallible</hi> Certainty is (if it be any where) there ≈øhould ari≈øe <hi>fal≈øe Teachers</hi> who ≈øhould bring in <hi>damnable</hi> Doctrines; which could never have happened if he had left any ≈øuch Means to his <hi>Church</hi> as ≈øhould render her Children infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly <hi>certain.</hi> All that he de≈øigned was to leave us ≈øuch <hi>≈øufficient</hi> Means of Certainty in <hi>Religion,</hi> as that we might not err either dangerou≈øly or damnably without <hi>our own</hi> Fault. He hath left us his Word, and in that hath plainly di≈øcovered to us all that is <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> for us to believe in order to <hi>eternal</hi> Life. He hath left us a <hi>≈øtanding</hi> Mini≈øtry in his <hi>Church</hi> to explain his <hi>Word</hi> to us, and to guide us in the Paths of Righteou≈øne≈øs and Truth; but ≈øtill he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires us to ≈øearch the <hi>one,</hi> and attend to the <hi>other</hi> with <hi>hone≈øt, humble,</hi> and <hi>teachable</hi> Minds; and if we do not, we may err not only dangerou≈øly but damnably, and it is but <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>ju≈øt</hi> we ≈øhould. But if we diligently ≈øearch the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and faithfully rely upon its Authority, without doing of which
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:154348:190"/>we ≈øearch it in vain; if we ≈øincerely attend to the <hi>publick</hi> Mini≈øtry, with Minds prepared to receive the Truth in the Love of it; though we may po≈ø≈øibly err in Matters of <hi>le≈øs</hi> Moment, yet as to all Things <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> to our <hi>eternal</hi> Salvaion our Faith ≈øhall be inviolably ≈øecured; and this is as much as any <hi>hone≈øt</hi> Man needs, or as any <hi>hone≈øt Church</hi> can promi≈øe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From hence al≈øo I infer that in the Matters of our Faith and <hi>Religion, God</hi> doth expect that we ≈øhould make u≈øe of <hi>our own</hi> Rea≈øon and Judgment. For to what end ≈øhould he put us upon ≈øearching the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> but that thereby we may inform our ≈øelves what tho≈øe Things are which he hath requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us to believe and practi≈øe? But if it were his Mind that we ≈øhould wholly rely upon the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of our <hi>Church,</hi> or of our <hi>Spiritual Guides,</hi> and ≈øubmit our Faith to their Dictates without any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, what a <hi>needle≈øs</hi> and <hi>impertinent</hi> Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would this be for us, to ≈øearch and con≈øult the <hi>Scriptures?</hi> Con≈øult them, for what, if we are not to follow their Guidance and Direction, and to take the Mea≈øures of our Faith and Manners from them? And if for this End <hi>God</hi> hath obliged us to con≈øult them (as to be ≈øure it can be for no <hi>other</hi> End) then he hath obliged us to imploy <hi>our own</hi> Rea≈øon and Judgment, to con≈øider what they ≈øay, and enquire what they mean; otherwi≈øe he hath obliged us to con≈øult them to no Purpo≈øe. It is as evident therefore that <hi>God</hi> will have us u≈øe <hi>our own</hi> Rea≈øon and Judgment in di≈øcerning what we are to believe, and what not, in <hi>Religion,</hi> and not <hi>lazily</hi> rely upon <hi>others</hi> to <hi>≈øee</hi> and <hi>di≈øcern,</hi> and <hi>believe</hi> for us, as it is that he would have us ≈øearch and
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:154348:191"/>con≈øult the <hi>Scriptures;</hi> and that I think is evident enough, from what hath been ≈øaid, to any one that is not re≈øolved to admit of a Conviction. And indeed ≈øeeing our Rea≈øon is the <hi>noble≈øt</hi> Faculty we have, it would be very ≈øtrange if <hi>God</hi> ≈øhould not allow it to intermeddle in the <hi>highe≈øt</hi> and mo≈øt <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant</hi> Affair wherein he hath ingaged us; and ≈øeeing it is our Rea≈øon only that renders us <hi>capable</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> what an <hi>odd</hi> Thing would it be for <hi>God</hi> to for bid us making u≈øe of our Rea≈øon in the mo≈øt <hi>important</hi> Concerns of <hi>Religion,</hi> that is, in di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øhing what is <hi>true Religion</hi> from what is <hi>fal≈øe,</hi> and what we ought to believe from what we ought to reject? I know it is pretended by tho≈øe who urge the <hi>ab≈øolute</hi> Nece≈ø≈øity of ≈øubmitting our Rea≈øon to the <hi>Church,</hi> that they allow Men to make U≈øe of their <hi>own</hi> Rea≈øon and Judgment in di≈øcovering which the <hi>true Church</hi> is, and that all they contend for is only this, that when once Men have found the <hi>true Church</hi> they ought to enquire no farther, but immediately to deliver up their Rea≈øon and Under≈øtanding to it, and believe every Thing it believes without any farther Examination. So that before Men come into their <hi>Church,</hi> it ≈øeems they are allowed to ≈øee for them≈øelves, but after they are <hi>in,</hi> they mu≈øt wink and follow their Guides, and depute them to ≈øee and under≈øtand for them; which to ≈øuch Men as are not quite <hi>≈øick</hi> of their <hi>own</hi> Rea≈øon and Under≈øtandings ≈øhould me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks be a <hi>great</hi> Temptation to keep them out of their <hi>Church for ever:</hi> For if I may judge for my ≈øelf while I am <hi>out</hi> of it, but mu≈øt not while I am <hi>in</hi> it, I mu≈øt be very <hi>fond</hi> of parting with my <hi>own</hi> Eyes and Rea≈øon if ever I come <hi>into</hi> it at all. But
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:154348:191"/>≈øuppo≈øe I was always <hi>in</hi> it, and had been bred <hi>up</hi> in its Communion from my Infancy, will they allow me when I come to the <hi>full</hi> u≈øe of my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon fairly to que≈øtion whether theirs be the only <hi>true Church</hi> or no, and to hear the Rea≈øons, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and con≈øult the Doctors on both ≈øides? No, by no means; this I am forbid under the penalty of being deprived of the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of <hi>Prie≈øtly Ab≈øolution.</hi> So that in ≈øhort they will allow me to make U≈øe of my Rea≈øon if I have been bred an <hi>Heretick</hi> in order to my Reconciliation to their <hi>Church,</hi> but if I have never been an <hi>Heretick</hi> I mu≈øt never u≈øe my Rea≈øon to examine the Truth either of my <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Religion;</hi> that is to ≈øay, I may u≈øe my Rea≈øon when there is no <hi>other</hi> Remedy, and I mu≈øt continue a <hi>Heretick</hi> if I do not: But it were much better that I had never had Occa≈øion to u≈øe my Rea≈øon at all.

The <hi>Chri≈øtian</hi> Faith in tho≈øe Days lay within a <hi>narrow</hi> compa≈øs, and ≈øo it continued till the Wantonne≈øs and Curio≈øity of <hi>≈øucceeding</hi> Ages ≈øtarted <hi>di≈øputable</hi> Opinions, and as they prevailed, <hi>adopted</hi> them into the Family of Faith; in≈øomuch, that in proce≈øs of Time, <hi>≈øundry</hi> Opinions were received, that were never ≈øo much as heard of, in the <hi>Apo≈øtolical Age;</hi> and as ≈øoon as they were received, they were pre≈øently declared nece≈ø≈øary Articles. And as for the <hi>contradictory</hi> Opinions, though <hi>Chri≈øtianity</hi> was little or nothing concerned whether they were <hi>true</hi> or <hi>fal≈øe;</hi> yet they ≈øeldom underwent any <hi>milder</hi> Name than <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øie,</hi> or <hi>gentler</hi> Doom than Damnation; which hath been one of the <hi>grand</hi> Occa≈øions of all the Ruptures and Divi≈øions that have happened in the <hi>Chri≈øtian</hi> World. But as for the Faith which the <hi>Apo≈øtle</hi> here ≈øpeaks of, it was of a much <hi>le≈øs</hi> Bulk than what it is now arrived to by rolling through the <hi>wild</hi> Opiniatry of <hi>Sixteen Di≈øputation Ages,</hi> which by degrees have ≈øwelled it from a <hi>≈øhort</hi> ≈øcript into a <hi>large</hi> Volume. For if we look into the <hi>New Te≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and into the Writings of the mo≈øt <hi>Primitive Fathers,</hi> we ≈øhall find the Sums of <hi>Chri≈øtian</hi> Faith therein contained, con≈øi≈øting of very <hi>few</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, and tho≈øe ≈øuch only as are <hi>e≈ø≈øential</hi> to <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian Religion,</hi> and ≈øuch as wherein almo≈øt all the <hi>differing</hi> Per≈øua≈øions of <hi>Chri≈øtians</hi> do to this Day concenter. To hold the Faith therefore is to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øevere immovably in the Profe≈ø≈øion of the <hi>true Christian</hi> Doctrine, ≈øo far as in us lies, and not to
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:154348:194"/>be prevailed upon to de≈øert or for≈øake it, either through <hi>Fear</hi> of Per≈øecution, or <hi>Hope</hi> of <hi>Temporal</hi> Advantage, or the <hi>Knavi≈øh</hi> Arts and <hi>Sly</hi> In≈øinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>fal≈øe</hi> Teachers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>≈øecond</hi> Term here to be explained, is, What is meant by keeping a <hi>good Con≈øcience?</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience in general is nothing but our <hi>practical</hi> Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment directing us what we ought to <hi>do,</hi> and what to <hi>avoid,</hi> and <hi>approving</hi> or <hi>reproving,</hi> according as we follow its Directions, or run counter to them. The Con≈øcience therefore is <hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the Directions are which it gives for the Government of our Lives and Actions. If our Judgment be <hi>fal≈øe</hi> and <hi>erroneous,</hi> and directs us to <hi>do</hi> what we ought to <hi>avoid,</hi> or to <hi>avoid</hi> what we ought to <hi>do,</hi> it is a <hi>bad</hi> Con≈øcience, that in≈øtead of being a Light to guide our Steps in the Paths of Righteou≈øne≈øs, is only a <hi>wandring Night-fire</hi> that leads us into Bogs and Quagmires. As on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, A <hi>good</hi> Con≈øcience is our <hi>practical</hi> Judgment well informed, and truly directing us in the Cour≈øe of our Actions what we ought to <hi>do,</hi> and what to <hi>avoid:</hi> For a <hi>good</hi> Con≈øcience is the <hi>true</hi> Eccho of <hi>God</hi> within us, that faithfully re≈øounds his Voice, and upon all Opportunities of Action, repeats after him to our Wills and Affections. To keep a <hi>good</hi> Con≈øcience therefore implies <hi>two</hi> Things: <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> To maintain in our Minds a <hi>true</hi> Sen≈øe of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> and ≈øo far forth as in us lies, to pre≈øerve our <hi>practical</hi> Judgment <hi>pure</hi> from all <hi>fal≈øe</hi> Principles of Action, and not to ≈øuffer ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our <hi>vicious</hi> Inclinations or <hi>worldly</hi> Intere≈øt to warp and ≈øeduce it, and cau≈øe it to mi≈øtake <hi>Evil</hi> for <hi>Good,</hi> and <hi>Good</hi> for <hi>Evil. Secondly,</hi> It implies
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:154348:195"/>our following the Dictates and Directions of a <hi>good</hi> Con≈øcience, our doing what it <hi>bids,</hi> and ab≈øtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from what it <hi>forbids,</hi> and faithfully re≈øigning our ≈øelves to its Conduct and Government, and not to be prevailed upon by any Temptation what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoever to act counter to its Sen≈øe and Per≈øua≈øion. In ≈øhort, To keep a <hi>good Con≈øcience</hi> is to live in a <hi>≈øtrict</hi> Conformity to the Dictates of a <hi>well-informed</hi> Judgment, and not to allow our ≈øelves in any Cour≈øe of Action which this Vice-God within us forbids or di≈øapproves.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Third</hi> Term to be explained in the Text, is, What is meant by <hi>putting away a good Con≈øcience;</hi> which being directly oppo≈øed here to keeping a <hi>good Con≈øcience,</hi> mu≈øt denote the Contraries to it. To put away a <hi>good Con≈øcience</hi> therefore is either, <hi>first,</hi> to corrupt <hi>our own</hi> Judgment of Things and Actions out of <hi>vicious</hi> Affection or <hi>worldly</hi> Intere≈øt, and impo≈øe upon our ≈øelves <hi>fal≈øe</hi> Notions of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil;</hi> or, <hi>≈øecondly,</hi> to act directly contrary to our Sen≈øe and Per≈øua≈øion; to leave <hi>undone</hi> tho≈øe Things which <hi>our own</hi> Con≈øcience tells us we ought to <hi>do,</hi> and to <hi>do</hi> tho≈øe things which it tells us we ought not to <hi>do.</hi> In ≈øhort, to put away a <hi>good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience</hi> is to live in any <hi>known</hi> Cour≈øe of Sin, either of <hi>Omi≈ø≈øion</hi> or <hi>Commi≈ø≈øion;</hi> to practi≈øe Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to <hi>our own</hi> Judgments, and to follow the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of our Wills again≈øt the Light and Conviction of our Con≈øciences.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>last</hi> Enquiry, is, What is here meant by making <hi>≈øhipwrack of the Faith?</hi> which being here ≈øet in Oppo≈øition to <hi>holding</hi> or <hi>keeping the Faith,</hi> mu≈øt ≈øignifie oppo≈øitely, and con≈øequently mu≈øt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note not holding and keeping it; or which is the
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:154348:195"/>≈øame thing, lo≈øing and abandoning it: For in this <hi>Allegory,</hi> the <hi>true Chri≈øtian</hi> Faith is repre≈øented as a Ship, and a <hi>good Con≈øcience,</hi> or a <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> Life as the Pilot, that ≈øteers and governs it. And indeed, in that State of Things there was no <hi>other</hi> Pilot, but Purity of Con≈øcience and Holine≈øs of Life was able to conduct and pre≈øerve this Ship, and carry it <hi>≈øafe</hi> through tho≈øe <hi>ince≈ø≈øant</hi> Storms of Per≈øecution, wherein at that time it was to≈øs'd and agitated. For when <hi>Chri≈øtians</hi> have once thrown <hi>off</hi> the Obligations of a <hi>good Con≈øcience,</hi> by abandoning them≈øelves to a <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>di≈ø≈øolute</hi> Life, what is there left to re≈øtrain them from abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Faith when it ≈øtands in Competition with their Worldly Ea≈øe and Intere≈øt? And though there ≈øhould be no Competition between their Faith and Intere≈øt, but they might freely enjoy them both without any di≈øturbance; yet their <hi>wicked</hi> Lives will naturally tempt them to corrupt their Faith with <hi>wicked</hi> Principles; of which <hi>later</hi> in the next Ver≈øe, he gives an <hi>eminent</hi> in≈øtance in <hi>Hymenaeus,</hi> who had not wholly de≈øerted <hi>Chri≈øtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> but only renounced <hi>one Fundamental</hi> Article of it, <hi>viz.</hi> The Re≈øurrection of the Dead: As of the <hi>former,</hi> he gives <hi>another</hi> In≈øtance in <hi>Alexander,</hi> who as it ≈øeems probable, had through the Fear of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øecution de≈øerted <hi>Chri≈øtianity</hi> it ≈øelf.</p>
               <p>The Words thus explained may be re≈øolved into this Sen≈øe, <hi>That Mens living wickedly again≈øt the Convictions and Obligations of their Con≈øcience, doth very much expo≈øe them to Apo≈øtacy from true Religion into gro≈øs and impious Errors.</hi> Thus to <hi>the love of money, which is the root of all evil, the Apo≈øtle</hi> attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes Mens Erring <hi>from the Faith,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.10.

               <p n="1">1. When you fall under any Temptation to Change, ask your <hi>own</hi> Soul whether your Prejudice lye on the ≈øide of your <hi>pre≈øent</hi> Religion, or of that which you are tempted to turn to?

For though I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øs it is a Fault for Men ≈øo to preingage them≈øelves

So that upon comparing their <hi>Athei≈øtical</hi> Lives with the <hi>loud</hi> Cry they make about the <hi>true Catholick Faith</hi> and <hi>Church,</hi> one would be tempted to think that their <hi>Chri≈øtianity</hi> began at the <hi>wrong</hi> End of their <hi>Creed,</hi> and that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in the <hi>Holy Catholick Church</hi> before they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>in God the Father Almighty,</hi> or in <hi>Je≈øus Chri≈øt his only Son our Lord;</hi> Which is ≈øuch a <hi>gro≈øs</hi> and <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øom</hi> Piece of Hypocri≈øy as one would think any <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de≈øt</hi> Man ≈øhould be a≈øhamed of. For in the name of <hi>God;</hi> Sirs, What have you to do to wrangle and make a Noi≈øe about <hi>Religion,</hi> who≈øe <hi>profligate</hi> Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are a Shame and Scandal to <hi>common</hi> Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? It is a Reproach to any <hi>Religion</hi> for <hi>you</hi> to name it, and Shame to any <hi>Church</hi> for <hi>you</hi> to pretend to it; and therefore when ≈øuch as <hi>you</hi> rai≈øe a Cry after the <hi>true Church</hi> and <hi>true Religion,</hi> it is a <hi>plain</hi> Ca≈øe that whatever Pretence you bring upon the Stage you are prompted by ≈øome <hi>ba≈øe</hi> Intere≈øt behind the Curtain. And is it not a <hi>plea≈øant</hi> Thing to hear ≈øuch <hi>Profligates</hi> as the≈øe pretend to be <hi>Converts,</hi> who only turn from <hi>one</hi> Opinion to <hi>another,</hi> but ≈øtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue as <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>unreformed</hi> in their Manners un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Opinion they turn to, as they were under <hi>that</hi> they turned from? The≈øe are ≈øuch Converts as there is no <hi>Church</hi> in the World that advances <hi>true</hi> Piety above <hi>worldly</hi> Intere≈øt, but would glory to lo≈øe, and blu≈øh to gain: And what <hi>Diogenes</hi> ≈øaid of a <hi>wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> Fellow that prai≈øed him, that the <hi>Religion</hi> may
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:154348:218"/>≈øay which tho≈øe Men turn to, <hi>What Hurt have I done, what wicked Principles am I guilty of, that ≈øuch vile Wretches as the≈øe ≈øhould commend and embrace me?</hi> For for God's ≈øake, what is it that they are converted to? Is it to any Thing that renders them <hi>wi≈øer</hi> or <hi>better</hi> Men? No, The contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is <hi>too notorious</hi> through the whole Cour≈øe of their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Well then, it ≈øeems they are converted to ≈øomething that doth them no manner of Good, that ≈øerves them to no <hi>true</hi> End of <hi>Religion,</hi> that is to a <hi>meer empty</hi> Notion that only gingles about their Under≈øtandings, but hath no <hi>good</hi> Influence on their Hearts and Manners. Had their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øion proceeded-upon <hi>pure</hi> Principles of Con≈øcience, that would have obliged them to change their Manners as well as their Opinions; there being very <hi>few</hi> Opinions in <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> ≈øo <hi>contradictory</hi> to the <hi>natural</hi> Sentiments of Con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as a <hi>vicious</hi> and <hi>immoral</hi> Life. Suppo≈øing that the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Supremacy, Purgatory,</hi> and <hi>Tran≈øub≈øtantiation</hi> were true, yet that the <hi>contrary</hi> Doctrins to the≈øe are Errors can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ≈øo evident to any Man's Con≈øcience, as that <hi>Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne≈øs, Adultery, Fraud</hi> and <hi>Oppre≈ø≈øion</hi> are Sins; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for any Man to pretend that he for≈øook <hi>tho≈øe</hi> Errors out of Con≈øcience, who yet makes no Con≈øcience of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing in <hi>the≈øe</hi> Sins is ≈øuch a <hi>tran≈øparent</hi> Hypocri≈øy as hath not Vizor and Di≈øguize enough to abu≈øe either the mo≈øt <hi>Candid</hi> or <hi>Credulous.</hi> If therefore before you are re≈øolved to for≈øake your Sins you are tempted to for≈øake your <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> it is a <hi>plain</hi> Ca≈øe that it is not your Con≈øcience or Conviction that tempts you, but your Lu≈øt or Intere≈øt. Had it been Con≈øcience, it would have been far more <hi>importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> with you to reform your Manners than your Faith, and to become <hi>good</hi> Men, than <hi>Catholick Believers;</hi> and therefore under your <hi>pre≈øent</hi> Circum≈øtances you ought to be very <hi>careful</hi> what you do, and how you comply with the Temptation, le≈øt to all the Re≈øt of your Sins you add that <hi>foul</hi> and <hi>fatal</hi> one of Apo≈øtacy, and thereby fill up the Mea≈øure of your Iniquities, and <hi>finally</hi> provoke <hi>Almighty God</hi> to abandon you as you have abandoned him, and give you up for <hi>lo≈øt</hi> and <hi>de≈øperate.</hi>
